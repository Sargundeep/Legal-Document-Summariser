94.0,Murder,"CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION Criminal Appeal No. 17 of 1951. Appeal against a Judgment and. Order dated 22nd January, 1951, of the High Court of Judicature at Patna (Imam J.) in Criminal Revision No. 1533 of 1950  P. Sinha (P.S. Safeer and K.N. Aggarwal, with him) for the appellants. The respondent did not appear. 1951. May 24. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by PATANJALI SASTRI J.--This is an appeal by special leave from an order of the High Court of Judicature at Patna setting aside an order of acquittal of the appellants by the Sessions Judge, Purnea, and directing their retrial.  The appellants were prosecuted for alleged offences under sections 147, 148, 323, 324, 326, 302 and 302/149 of the Indian Penal Code at the instance of one Polai Lal Biswas who lodged a complaint against them before the po- lice.  The prosecution case was that, while the complainant was harvesting the paddy crop on his field at about 10 a.m. on 29th November, 1949, a mob of about fifty persons came on to the field armed with ballams, lathis and other weapons and that the first appellant Logendranath Jha, who was leading the mob, demanded a settlement of all outstanding disputes with the complainant and ,said he would not allow the paddy to be removed unless the disputes were settled. An altercation followed as a result of which Logendra or- dered an assault by his men. Then Logendra and one of his men, Harihar, gave ballam blows to one of the labourers, Kangali, who fell down and died on the spot.  Information was given to the police who investigated the case and submitted the charge-sheet. The committing Magistrate found that a prima facie case was made out and committed the appellants to the Court of Sessions for trial. The appellants pleaded not guilty alleging inter alia, that Mohender and Debender, the brothers of Logendra (appel- lants 2 and 3) were not present in the village of Dandkhora with which they had no concern, as all the lands in that village had been allotted to Logendra at a previous parti- tion, that Logendra himself was not in the village at the time of the occurrence but arrived soon after and was dragged to the place at the instance of his enemies in the village and was placed under arrest by the Assistant Sub-Inspector of Police who had arrived there previously.  It was also alleged that there were two factions in the village, one of which was led by one Harimohan, a relation of the complainant, and the other by Logendra and there had been numerous revenue and criminal proceedings and long-standing enmity between the families of these leaders as a result of which this false case was foisted upon the appellants.  The learned Sessions Judge examined the evidence in great detail and found that the existence of factions as alleged by the appellants was true. He found, however, that the appellants plea of alibi was not satisfactorily made out, but the truth of the prosecution, he proceeded to observe, cannot be judged by the falsehood of the defence nor can the prosecution derive its strength from the weak- ness of the defence. Prosecution must stand on its own legs and must prove the story told by it at the very first stage. The manner of occurrence alleged by the prosecution must be established beyond doubt before the accused persons can be convicted.  Approaching the case in this manner and seeing that the basis of the prosecution case was that Polai had batai settlement of the disputed land and had raised the paddy crop which he was harvesting when the occurrence took place, the learned Sessions Judge examined the evidence of the prosecution witnesses who belonged to the opposite faction critically and found that the story of the prosecu- tion was not acceptable. Polai, who was alleged to have taken the land on batai settlement from his own maternal grandmother Parasmani who brought him up from his childhood, was only 19 years old and unmarried and was still living with his grandmother.  He did not claim to be a bataidar of any other person. In these circumstances, said the learned Judge, it does not appear to me to be probable that Polai would have been allowed to maintain himself by running adhi cultivation of his mamus land in the lifetime of his nani who has brought him up from his infancy like her own child. Nor does it appeal to me that the unmarried boy Polai would have undertaken upon himself the task of run- ning batai cultivation of the lands of his mamu where he has been living since his childhood without any trouble, more particularly in view of the heavy expenses of cultivation brought out by the evidence of Tirthanand (P.W. 14).  He, therefore, disbelieved the whole story that Polai had taken the lands of his grandmother or his uncles as bataidar for cultivation and that he was engaged in harvesting the paddy crop on the lands at the time of the occurrence.  This false story, in his opinion, vitally affected the prosecution case regarding the alleged manner of the occurrence. He also found a number of discrepancies and contradictions in the evidence of the prosecution witnesses, which, in his view, tended to show that the prosecution was guilty of concealment of the real facts.In view of such conceal- ment of real facts, the learned Judge concluded, it does not appear to me to be possible to apportion liability and to decide which of the two parties commenced the fight and which acted in self-defence. Such being the position, it is not possible at all to hold either party responsible for what took place. In such a view of the matter coupled with the fact that the manner of occurrence alleged by the prose- cution has not been established to be true beyond doubt, I think that the accused persons cannot be safely convicted of any of the offences for which they have been charged. The learned Judge accordingly acquitted the appellants of all the charges framed against them. Against that order the complainant Polai preferred a revision petition to the High Court under section 439 of the Criminal Procedure Code., The learned Judge who heard the petition reviewed the evidence at some length and came to the conclusion that the judgment of the learned Sessions Judge could not be allowed to stand as the acquittal of the appellants was perverse . In his opinion, the entire judgment displays a lack of true perspective in a case of this kind. The Sessions Judge had completely misdirected himself in looking to the minor discrepancies in the case and ignoring the essential matters so far as the case is concerned, and there was no justifiable ground for rejecting the prosecution evidence regarding the cultivation and harvesting by Polai. And he concluded with the warning I would, however, make it per- fectly clear that when the case is re-tried, which I am now going to order, the Judge proceeding with the trial will not be in the least influenced by any expression of opinion which I may have given in this judgment. On behalf of the appellants Mr. Sinha raised two conten- tions. In the first place, he submitted that having regard to section 417 of the Criminal Procedure Code which provides for an appeal to the High Court from an order of acquittal only at the instance of the Government, a revision petition under section 439 at the instance of a private party was incompetent, and, secondly, that sub-section (4) of section 439 clearly showed that the High Court exceeded its powers of revision in the present case in upsetting the findings of fact of the trial Judge. We think it is unnecessary to express any opinion on the first contention of Mr. Sinha especially as the respondent is unrepresented, as we are of opinion that his second and alternative contention must prevail. It will be seen from the judgment summarised above that the learned Judge in the High Court re-appraised the evi- dence in the case and disagreed with the Sessions Judges findings of fact on the ground that they were perverse and displayed a lack of true perspective. He went further and, by way of expressing in very clear terms as to how perverse the judgment of the court below is, he indicated that the discrepancies in the prosecution evidence and the circum- stances of the case which led the Sessions Judge to discred- it the prosecution story afforded no justifiable ground for the conclusion that the prosecution failed to establish their case.We are of opinion that the learned Judge in the High Court did not properly appreciate the scope of inquiry in revision against an order of acquittal. Though sub-section(1) of section 439 authorises the High Court to exercise, in its discretion, any of the powers conferred on a court of appeal by section 423, sub-section (4) specifically excludes the power to convert a finding of acquittal into one. of conviction. This does not mean that in dealing with a revision petition by a private party against an order of acquittal, the High Court could in the absence of any error on a point of law re-appraise the evidence and reverse the findings of facts on which the acquittal was based, provided only it stopped short of finding the accused guilty and passing sentence on him. By merely characterising the judgment of the trial Court as perverse and lacking in perspective, the High Court cannot reverse pure findings of fact based on the trial Courts appreciation of the evidence in the case.DECISION ??"

Appeal under Art. 134 (1) (c) of the Constitution of India against the Judgment and Order dated the 10th April, 1950, of the High Court of Judicature at Simla in Criminal Revision No. 449 of 1949. The facts of the case appear in the judgment. Kundan Lal Arora for the appellant. S.N. Chopra for the respondent. 1951. May 23. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Bose J. --This is a criminal appeal against a convic- tion under section 16 of the Punjab Trade Employees Act, 1940, as amended in 1943, read with section 7(1). The appellant is a shopkeeper who owns and runs a shop in the Cantonment Area of Ferozepore. He has no employees within the meaning of the Act but is assisted by his son in running the shop. The shop is divided into two sections. In one, articles of haberdashery are sold in the other, articles of stationery. Section 7(1) of the Act as amended requires that Save as otherwise provided by this Act, every shop shall remain closed on a close day. Sub-section (2)(i) states that-- The choice of a close day shall rest with the owner or occupier of a shop and shall be intimated to the prescribed authority within etc. The appellant made the following choice. He elected to close the haberdashery section on Mondays and the stationery section on Saturdays and gave the necessary intimation to the prescribed authority to that effect. On Monday, the 17th of May, 1948, the appellants son sold a tin of boot polish to a customer from the haberdash- ery, section of the shop. The appellant was present in person at the time of the sale. Monday was a close day for the haberdashery section and so the appellant was prosecuted under section 16 read with section 7. The trying Magistrate held that in selling the article of haberdashery on a close day and in not observing Monday as a close day the appellant had infringed the provisions of section 7(1) of the Act. He accordingly convicted him and imposed a fine of Rs. 20. A revision application to the High Court failed. The High Court held that as the appellant had failed to keep his shop closed one day in the week, his conviction was proper. A certificate for leave to appeal to this Court, on the ground that a substantial question of law relating to the Govern- ment of India Act, 1935, was involved, was granted and that is how we come to be seized of the matter. The learned counsel for the appellant contended that section 7 of the Act is ultra vires in that it does not fall under any of the items in either the Provincial or the Concurrent Legislative Lists in the Government of India Act, 1935. In our opinion, the matter can come either under item No. 27 in List II or item No. 27 in List III. Item No. 27 in List II covers trade and commerce within the Province. In our opinion, a Provincial Government could, under that entry, regulate the hours, place, date and manner of sale of any particular commodity or commodities. It could, for example, state that the sale of explosives or other dangerous substances should only be in selected areas, at specified times or on specified days when extra precau- tions for the general safety of the public and those direct- ly concerned could be arranged for. That would appear to be obvious. In the same way, it could, if it so pleased, say that there shall be no sales on a particular day, say a Sunday or a Friday, or on days of religious festivals and so forth. Instead of doing that, it has chosen to regulate the internal trade of the Province in this manner which is only one of the various ways in which it could have acted. The matter can also be brought under item 27 in List III welfare of labour conditions of labour. The im- pugned section is a general one and applies to all kinds of shops that is to say, to those in which labour is employed as well as to those which are run by the owners and their families. The Act in which the section occurs is directed at regulating the hours of employment of persons who are employed in the business of shops or commercial establish- ments. Therefore, in so far as section 7 covers establish- ments where labour is employed, it is undoubtedly intra vires. But it was argued that the section can have no appli- cation to shops which an owner runs with or without the assistance of his family. Reliance for this was placed on section 2-A (i) and (j) which is as follows 2-A. Nothing in this Act shall apply to--  persons employed in a managerial capacity and (j) the members of the family of the employer. It was argued that the sale was by the son. He is not affected by the Act. Therefore. he was entitled to sell and he could not sell unless the shop was kept open to enable him to do so. So also as regards the appel- lant, the owner, who was there in a managerial capacity. In our opinion, this is fallacious because the conviction here is not for the sale but for keeping the shop open on a close day. Section 2-A (j) does not give the son a right to keep the shop open or, for that matter, a right to sell. All it says is that he, being a member of the family, shall not be affected by the provisions of the Act. Section 7(1), on the other hand, is directed against the owner of the shop, not against his family. It compels the owner to keep his shop closed one day in a week.  It was then contended that if a person employed in a managerial capacity cannot be affected by the Act, then the appellant who was there in that capacity cannot be compelled to close the shop under section 7. This is also fallacious. It happens in the present case that the owner and the manag- er are the same but the Act obviously makes provision for a class of case in which they are different. The owner is obliged to close the shop one day in a week, though the manager of the shop can work without, for example, having the twenty-four consecutive hours of rest every week which section 7-A enjoins. The appellants capacity as manager will have to be separated from his character as owner for this purpose. Section 2-A(i) does not control section 7 (1). Lastly, it was argued that the scheme of the Act makes it plain that it is for ameliorating the conditions of labour employed in shops. It cannot therefore apply to shops in which no labour is employed, particularly when the family of the employer is expressly excluded from the purview of the Act. For this reason also, it cannot fall under item 27 in List III. We are of opinion that such a narrow interpre- tation cannot be placed upon the entry. The legislature may have felt it necessary, in order to reduce the possibilities of evasion to a minimum, to encroach upon the liberties of those who would not otherwise have been affected. That we think it had power to do. DECISION ??"

Appeal by special leave from the Judgment dated June 27, 1951, of the Labour Appellate Tribunal of India at Calcutta in Appeals Nos. 94 and 142 of 1950 arising out of the Award of the Second Industrial Tribunal, Madras (published in the Fort St. George Gazette, Madras, dated October 3, (1950). C. Chatterjee (S. N. Mukherjee, with him) for the appellant. C. C. Anthoni Pillai (President, Madras Labour Union) for the respondents. 1952. December 2. The Judgment of the Court Was delivered by MAHAJAN J. MAHAJAN J.-This is an appeal by special leave from a decision dated 27th June, 1951, of the Labour Appellate Tribunal of India at Calcutta in appeals Nos. 94 and 142 of 1950, arising out of the award of the Second Industrial Tribunal, Madras. The relevant facts and circumstances giving rise to the appeal are as follows On 1st November, 1948, 859 night shift operatives of the carding and spinning department of the Carnatic Mills stopped work, some at 4 p.m., some at 4- 30 p.m. and some at 5 p.m. The stoppage ended at 8 p.m. in both the departments. By 10 p.m, the strike ended completely. The apparent cause for the strike was that the management of the Mills had expressed its inability to comply with the request of the workers to declare the forenoon of the 1st November, 1948, as a holiday for solar eclipse. On the 3rd November, 1948, the management put up a notice that the stoppage of work on the 1st November amounted to an illegal strike and a break in service within the meaning of the Factories Act (XXV of 1934) and that the management had decided that the workers who had participated in the said strike would not be entitled to holidays with pay as provided by the Act. This position was not accepted by the Madras Labour Union. The Madras Government by an order dated the 11th July, 1949, made under section 10(1) (c) of the Industrial Disputes Act (XIV of 1947), referred this dispute along with certain other disputes to the Industrial Tribunal, Madras. The adjudicator gave the award which was published in the Gazette on 12th October, 1950. By his award the adjudicator found that there could be little doubt that the stoppage of work by the night shift workers on the night of the last November,, 1948, was a strike, that it was an illegal strike, since the textile industry is notified as a public utility industry and there could be no legal strike without a proper issue of notice in the terms prescribed by the Industrial Disputes Act. No such notice had been given. In view of this finding he upheld the view of the management that the continuity of service of the workers was broken by the interruption caused by the illegal strike and that as a consequence the workers who participated in such strike were not entitled to annual holidays with pay under section 49-B (1) of the Factories Act. He, however, considered that the total deprivation of leave with pay ordered by the management was a severe punishment and on the assumption that he had power to scrutinize the exercise of the discretion by the management in awarding punishment, reduced the punishment by 50 per cent and held that the workers would be deprived of only half their holidays with pay. The decision of the management was varied to this extent. The Mills as well as the-Union appealed against this decision to the Labour Appellate Tribunal. That Tribunal upheld the contention of the Mills that the adjudicator had no power to interfere with and revise the, discretion of the management exercised by it under section 49-B (1). It also upheld the contention of the Union that what happened on the night of the 1st November did not amount to a strike and did not cause any interruption in the workers service. This is what the Tribunal said- It would be absurd to hold that non-permitted absence from work even for half an hour or less in the course of a working day would be regarded as interruption of service of a workman for the purpose of the said section. We are inclined to hold that the stoppage of Work for the period for about 2 to 4 hours in the circumstances of the case is not to be regarded as a strike so as to amount to a break in the continuity of service of the workman concerned. In the result the appeal of the Union on this point was allowed and it was ordered that holidays at full rates as provided for in section 49-A of the Factories Act will have to be calculated in respect of the operatives concerned on the footing that there was no break in the continuity of their service by the stoppage of work on 1st November, 1948. In this appeal it was contended on behalf of the Mills that on a proper construction of section 49-B (1) of the Factories Act (XXV of 1934) the management was right in its decision that the continuity of service was broken by the interruption caused by the illegal strike and that the workers were not entitled to annual holidays with pay under the said section inasmuch as they would not have completed a period of twelve months continuous service in the factory, and that the non-permitted absence as a result of concerted refusal to work even for 2 to 4 hours in the course of a working day amounts to an illegal strike and consequently an interruption of service of a workman for the purpose of section 49-B. In our judgment, this contention is well founded. Section 49-B provides- Every worker who has completed a period of twelve months continuous service in a factory shall be allowed, during the subsequent period of twelve months, holidays for a period of ten, or, if a child, fourteen Consecutive days, inclusive of the day or days, if any, on which he is entitled to a holiday under subsection (1) of section 35 Explanation.-A worker shall be deemed to have completed a period of twelve months continuous service in a factory notwithstanding any interruption in service during those twelve months brought about by sickness, accident or authorized leave not exceeding ninety days in the aggregate for all three or by a lookout, or by a strike which is not an illegal strike, or by intermittent periods of involuntary unemployment not exceeding thirty days It is clear that the benefit of this section is not avail- able in cases where the interruption in service is brought about by an illegal strike. Section 2 q ) of the Industrial, Disputes Act (Act XIV of 1947) defines strike as meaning- a cessation of work by a body of persons employed in any industry acting in combination, or a concerted refusal, or a refusal under a common understanding, of any number of persons who are or have been so employed to continue to work or to accept employment. The adjudicator found on the evidence and circumstances of the case that there was concert and combination of the workers in stopping and refusing resume work on the night of the 1st November He observed that the fact that a very large number of leave applications was put in for various reasons pointed to the concerted action and that the appli- cation given by the workers and their representatives also indicated that they were acting in combination both in striking and refusing to go back to work on the ground that they were entitled to leave for the night shift whenever a half a days leave was granted to the day shift workers. He further hold that the refusal of the workers to resume work in spite of the attempts made by the officers and their own Madras Labour Union representatives indicated that they were not as a body prepared to resume work unless their demand was conceded. In our opinion, the conclusion reached by the adjudicator was clearly right and the conclusion cannot be avoided that the workers were acting in concert. That being so, the action of the workers on the night of the 1st November clearly fell within the definition of the expression strike in section 2(q) of the Industrial Disputes Act. We have not been able to appreciate the view expressed by the Appellate Tribunal that stoppage of work for a period of two to four hours and such non-permitted absence from work cannot be regarded as strike. Before the adjudicator the only point raised by the Union was that it was a spontaneous and lightning strike but it was not said by them that stoppage of work did not fall within the definition of strike as given in the Act. It cannot be disputed -that there was a cessation of work by a body of persons employed in the Mills and that they were acting in combination and their refusal to go back to work was concerted. All the necessary ingredients,. therefore, of the definition exist in the present case and the stoppage of work on 1st November, 1948, amounted to a strike. It was not a case of an individual workers failure to turn up for work. It was a concerted action on the part of a large number of workers. The Appellate Tribunal was thus in error in not regarding it as a strike and it had no discretion not to regard what in law was a strike as not amounting to a strike. If it cannot be denied that the stoppage of work on 1st November, 1948, amounted to a strike, then it was certainly an illegal strike because no notice had been given to the management, the Mills being a public utility industry. It was contended by the President of the Union, who argued the case on behalf of the workers, that the Factories Act had no application to this case, because by a notification of the Government of Madras dated 23rd August, 1946, the Buckingham an Carnatic Mills had been exempted from the provisions of Chapter IV-A of the Act and the provisions of sections 49-A and 49-B were not therefore attracted to it and that no substantial question of law in respect to the construction of the section fell to be decided by this Court and that being so, this Court should not entertain this appeal under article 136 of the Constitution. This contention has no validity. The Mills were granted exemption from the provisions of Chapter IV-A of the Factories Act because their leave rules were in accordance with the provisions of Chapter IV-A of the Factories Act. These rules being in similar terms, the decision of the matter depends on the construction of the rules and this in- volves a substantial question of law. Reliance was next placed on section 49-A of the Factories Act which provides that the provisions of the new Act would not operate to the prejudice of any rights which the workers were entitled to under the earlier rules and it was argued that under the leave rules of the Mills which prevailed prior to the coming into force of the Factories Act, the workers were entitled to privilege leave and there was no provision in those rules similar to the one that has been made in section 49-B or in the new rules and that the Mills had no right to deprive them of leave by reason of the strike. This contention cannot be sustained because section 49-A (2) of the Factories Act has no application to the case of the Carnatic Mills in view of the notification dated 23rd August, 1946. Lastly, it was urged that the stoppage of work on 1st November, 1948, was not a concerted action -on the part of the workers and that several workers in their own individual capacity wanted leave on that date. In our opinion, in view of the facts and circumstances detailed in the adjudicators award this contention cannot be seriously considered. We concur in the view of the facts taken by the adjudicator that the action of the 859 workers on the night of 1st November, 1948, fell within the definition of the word strike as given in section 2(q) of the Industrial Disputes Act and it was an illegal strike and the workers thus lost the benefit of holidays that they would have otherwise got under the rules. The learned counsel for the appellant undertook on behalf of the management ex gratia that it would condone the default of the workers on 1st November, 1948, and the cessation of work on that night would not be treated as depriving them of the holidays under the rules and we appreciate -the spirit in which this undertaking was given and hope that the workers would also take it in that spirit.DECISION ??"

(2) of s. 10 of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, by its order dated June 11, 1956, referred the following dispute to the Tribunal - DEMAND Every Workman (daily rated) should be paid bonus for the year 1954-55 (year ending 30th June, 1955) equivalent to six-months wages without it attaching any condition thereto . Respondent No. I filed their statement of claim before -the Tribunal on June 29, 1956. They alleged that the profits of the appellant during the year 195455 were higher than those during the year 1953-54 for which year the appellant had paid four months basic wages as bonus. They also alleged that the wages paid to them by the appellant fell short of the, living wage and therefore the appellant should pay the in six months basic wages as bonus for the relative year. The appellant filed its written statement in answer on August 14, 1956. The appellant submitted that, after providing for the prior charges according to the formula laid down by the Labour Appellate Tribunal the profits made during the year under consideration did riot leave any surplus and tile, respondents were not entitled to any bonus. It denied that it bad made huge profits during the year in question and submitted that the profits made were not even sufficient to provide for the prior charges , etc. The Tribunal after hearing the parties came to the conclusion that even if payment of a bonus equal to 4 1/2 months basic wages were made a fair surplus would be left in the hands of the appellant to the tune of Rs. 3.30 lacs and therefore awarded the same subject to the following conditions- Any employee who has been dismissed for misconduct resulting in financial loss to the company shall not be entitled to bonus to the extent of the loss caused. Persons who are eligible for bonus but who are no longer in the service of the company on the date of the payment shall be paid the same provided that they make a written application for the same within three months of publication of this award. Such bonus shall be paid within one month of receipt of application provided that no claim can be enforced before six weeks from the date this award becomes enforceable. Being aggrieved by the said award of the Tribunal, the appellant applied for and obtained from this Court special leave to appeal against the same under Art. 136 of the Constitution and hence this appeal. The formula evolved by the Full Bench of the Labour Appellate Tribunal in Millowners Association, Bombay v. Rashtreeya Mill Mazdoor Sangh, Bombay(1) is based on this idea that as both labour and capital contribute to the earnings of the industrial concerti, it is fair that labour should derive some benefit, if there is a surplus after meeting prior or necessary charges . The following were prescribed as the first charges on (1) (1950) L.L.J. 1247 gross profits, viz., (1) Provision for depreciation (2) reserves for rehabilitation (3) a return at 6on the paid up capital (4) a return on the working capital at a lesser rate than the return on paid up capital and (5) an estimated amount in respect of the payment of income-tax. The surplus that remained after making the aforesaid deductions would be available for distribution among the three sharers, viz., the shareholders, the industry and the workmen See Muir Mills Co., Ltd. v. Suti Mills Mazdoor Union, Kanpur (1) and Sree Meenakshi Mills Ltd. v. Their Workmen (2). This Full Bench -Formula has been working all throughout the country since its enunciation as aforesaid and has been found to be, in the main, fairly satisfactory. It is conducive to the benefit of both labour and capital and even though certain variations have been attempted to be made therein from time to time the main features thereof have not been substantially departed from. We feel that a formula which has been thus adopted all throughout the country and has so far worked fairly satisfactorily should be adhered, to, though there is scope for certain flexibility in the working thereof in accordance with the exigencies of the situation. In the working of the said formula, however, regard must be had both to the interests of capital and labour. In any given industry there are three interests involved, viz., the shareholders, the Company and the workmen and all these interests have got to get their proper share in the surplus profits ascertained after due provision is made for these prior charges . The shareholders may look to larger dividends commensurate with the prosperity of the industrial concern, the company would, apart from rehabilitation and replacement of buildings, plant and machinery, look forward to expansion and satisfaction of other needs of the industry and the workmen would certainly be entitled to ask for a share in the surplus profits with a view to bridge the gap between the wages earned by them and the living wages. All these interests (1) 19551 1,s.C.R. 991, 998. (2) 1958 S.C.R 878, 884, have, therefore, got to be duly and properly provided for having regard to the principles of social justice and once surplus profits available for distribution amongst these respective interests are determined after making due provision for the prior charges as aforesaid the Industrial Tribunal adjudicating upon the dispute would have a free hand in the distribution of the same having regard, of course, to the considerations mentioned hereinabove. But so far as the determination of the surplus profits is concerned the formula must be adhered to in its essential particulars as otherwise there would be no stability nor uniformity of practice in regard to the same. It maybe noted, however, that in regard to the depreciation which is a prior charge on the gross profits earned by a concern there is always a difference in the method of approach which is adopted by the income-tax authorities and by the industrial tribunals. It was pointed out by us in Sree Meenakshi Mills Ltd. v. Their Workmen (1) that the whole of the depreciation admissible under the Income-tax Act was not allowable in determining the available surplus. The initial depreciation and the additional depreciation were abnormal additions to the income-tax depreciation and it would not be fair to the workmen if these depreciations were rated as prior charges before the available surplus was ascertained. Considerations on which the grant of initial and additional depreciations might be justified under the Income-tax Act were different from considerations of social justice and fair apportionment on which the Full Bench Formula in regard to the payment of bonus to workmen was based. This was the reason why we held in that case that only normal depreciation including multiple shift depreciation, but not initial or additional depreciation should rank as prior charge. We approved of the decision of the Labour Appellate Tribunal in U. P. Electric Supply Co., Ltd. v. Their Workmen (2) in arriving at the above conclusion and disallowed the claim of the company there to deduct the initial or additional depreciation as prior charge in bonus calculations. (1) 1958 S.C.R. 878. (2) (1955) L.A.C. 659. When this decision was reached we had not before us the decision of the Labour Appellate Tribunal in Surat Electricity Companys Staff Union v. The Surat Electricity Co., Ltd. (1) where a Bench of the Labour Appellate Tribunal had negatived the contention that if only the normal depreciation allowed by the Income-tax law were allowed a company would be able to recoup the original cost of the assets and observed that For the purpose of bonus formula the initial and additional depreciation, which are disallowed by that formula, must be ignored in fixing the written down value and in determining the period over which the normal depreciation will be allowed. The result will be a notional amount of normal depreciation but, as we have said repeatedly the bonus formula is a notional formula. We have already expressed in the judgment delivered by us in Associated Cement Co., Ltd. v. Its Workmen (1) that for the purpose of the bonus formula the notional normal depreciation should be deducted from the gross profits calculated on the basis adopted in Surat Electric Supply Co. Staff Union v. Surat Electricity Co., Ltd. (1) and not merely the normal depreciation including multiple shift depreciation allowed by the income-tax authorities as stated in U. P. Electric Supply Co., Ltd. v. Their Workmen (3). It is well settled that the actual income-tax payable by the company on the basis of the full statutory depreciation allowed by the income-tax authorities for the relevant accounting year should be taken into account as a prior charge irrespective of any set off allowed by the Income-tax authorities for prior charges or any other considerations such as building up of income-tax reserves for payment of enhanced liabilities of income-tax accruing in future. It is also well settled that the calculations of the surplus available for distribution should be made having regard to the working of the industrial concern in the relevant (1) (1956) L.A.C. 443. (2) 1959 S.C.R. 925. (3) (1955) L.A.C. 659. accounting year without taking into consideration the credits or debits which are referable to the working of the previous years, e.g., the refund of excess profits tax paid in the past or loss of previous years carried forward but written off in the accounting year as also any provision that may have to be made to meet future liabilities, e.g., redemption of debenture stock, or provision for Provident Fund and Gratuity and other benefits, etc., which, however, necessary they may be, cannot be included in the category of prior charges. If regard be had to the principles enunciated above it is clear that the items of Rs. 1.14 lacs representing the Lahore factory balance written off, Rs. 0.34 lacs being patents written off, and Rs. 0.09 lacs shown as loss on sale of Tardeo property cannot be allowed as proper deductions from the gross profits for the purposes of bonus calculations. The first two items represented debits in connection with the working of previous years. Loss of the Lahore factory had been incurred during the three previous accounting years and had been carried forward from year to year and the only thing which was done during the year under consideration was that it was then written off as irre- coverable. The patents also had been worked off in previous years and the amounts spent in the purchase thereof were therefore to be written off but had reference to the working of the company during the previous years. The last item of Rs. 0.09 lacs was trivial and was therefore not pressed with the result that all these three items were rightly added back in the calculations of the gross profits of the appellant and the figure of gross profits taken at Rs. 36.21 lacs was correctly arrived at by the Tribunal. The depreciation allowed by the Tribunal was Rs. 9.82 lacs which was the full statutory depreciation allowed by the Income-tax authorities. That should not have been done and the only depreciation allowed should have been the notional normal depreciation which was agreed between the parties before us at Rs. 6.23 lacs. Working the figure of income-tax deducted by the appellant on the basis adopted in Shree Meenakshi Mills Ltd.  Their Workmen (1) the income-tax on the gross profits of Rs. 36.21 lacs less the statutory depreciation allowed by the income-tax authorities, viz., Rs. 9.82 lacs would be equivalent to 7 annas in the rupee on Rs. 26.39 lacs, i.e., Rs. 11.55 lacs thus leaving a balance of Rs. 16.82 lacs from which the other prior charges would have to be deducted in order to ascertain the distributable surplus. 6 return on the ordinary share capital and 5 return on the preference share capital would come to Rs. 4.30 lacs. The appellant, however, claimed that even on the preference shares 6 return should be allowed and not 5 even though preference shareholders were not entitled to anything beyond 5 under the terms of issue. The appellant obviously relied upon the wording of the formula return at 6 on the paid up capital and contended that the preference shares also being paid up capital it would be entitled to a return of 6 on the preference shares for the purposes of the bonus formula even though in fact it would have to pay only 5 return on the same. We cannot accept this contention. Even though the bonus formula is a notional one we cannot ignore the fact that in no event would the appellant be bound to pay to the preference shareholders anything beyond 5 by way of return. The Full Bench Formula cannot be so literally construed. There is bound to be some flexibility therein, the 6 which is prescribed there as the return on paid up capital is not inexorable, and the Tribunals could if the circumstances warrant vary the rate of interest either by increasing or decreasing the same. On the facts of this case however there is no warrant for allowing anything beyond 5 return on preference share capital and the amount of Rs. 4.30 lacs should therefore be deducted as another prior charge from the grsos profits of the appellant. 4 return on reserves used as working capital was calculated merely at a figure of Rs. 0.29 lacs worked out on a total figure of Rs. 7,42,139. The Tribunal (1) 1938 S.C.R. 876. did not take into consideration another sum of Rs. 41,81,196 which represented the depreciation fund which according to the appellant had been used as working capital during the year. If that had been allowed a further sum of Rs. 1.67 lacs should have been added to Rs. 0.29 lacs and the total amount of 4 return on reserves used as working capital would have amounted to Rs. 1.96 lacs. Two arguments were advanced against this contention of the appellant. One was that there was nothing like a depreciation fund, that it merely represented a credit item introduced in the balance-sheet as against the value of the fixed capital at its original cost and would have disappeared as such if the proper accounting basis had been adopted, viz., the fixed block bad been showed at its depreciated value after deducting the amount of depreciation from the original cost. Such book entries, it was contended, did not convert that credit item into a depreciation fund available to the company and there was therefore no basis for the contention that such a depreciation fund ever existed and could be used as working capital in the business. The other was that there was nothing on the record to show that such a depreciation fund, if any, had been, in fact, used as working capital in the business during that year. The answer furnished by the appellant in regard to both these contentions was that on a true reading of the balance- sheet Rs. 41,81,196 were reserves used as working capital, vide calculations in Exhibit C-12. Provision for depreciation was Rs. 1,10,29,954 and the paid up capital was Rs. 80,00,000 thus totaling to Rs. 1,90,29,954. The total capital block as shown in page 5 of the balance-sheet for the year ending June 30, 1955, was Rs. 1,48,48,758 and the working capital therefore was Rs. 41,81,196. This was apart from Rs. 7,42,139 which was the total of the three items at page 4 of the balance-sheet Rs. 98,405 capital reserves, Rs. 4,73,734 other reserves and Rs. 1,70,000 provision for doubtful debts as also the investments, cash and bank balance. This being the true position it follows on the facts of the present case that this amount was available for use as working capital and the balance-sheet showed that it was in fact so used. Moreover, DO objection was urged in this behalf nor was any finding to the contrary recorded by the Tribunal. We are, therefore, of the opinion that the reasoning adopted by the Tribunal was not correct and the appellant was entitled to 4 return on the reserves used as working capital including the sum of Rs. 41,81,196. The appellant was thus entitled to Rs. 1.96 lacs as the 4 return on reserves used as working capital and not merely Rs. 0.29 lacs as allowed by the Tribunal. The provision for rehabilitation bad been claimed by the appellant at Rs. 1.10 lacs on the basis of 10 of the net profits relying upon para. 20 of the Report of the Committee on Profit Sharing in which the Committee had proposed that 10 of the net profits should compulsorily be set aside for reserves to meet emergencies as well as for rehabilitation, modernization and reasonable expansion. No evidence was at all led by the appellant before the Tribunal showing the cost of the machinery as purchased, the age of the machinery, the estimate for replacement etc., in order to substantiate this claim for rehabilitation and the appellant was content merely to rely upon this recommendation of the Committee on Profit-sharing. This was rightly considered by the Tribunal as insufficient to support the appellants claim, though it allowed for rehabilitation, in addition to the statutory depreciation, the amount for which the appellant had actually made provision, viz., the sum by which the depreciation written off for the year exceeded the statutory depreciation (i. e., Rs. 10,00,000 minus Rs. 9,82,799Rs. 17,201). The amount was really small and did not affect the bonus to be awarded. The Tribunal, in fact, allowed the same, though it appears that in the absence of evidence of the nature above referred to even that sum of Rs. 0.17 lacs ought not to have been allowed. In this state of affairs it is really impossible for us to allow the appellants claim for rehabilitation in anything beyond the sum of Rs. 0.17 lacs actually allowed by the Tribunal and the claim of the appellant for any further provision for rehabilitation must be disallowed for the purpose of the bonus calculations for the year under consideration. It will however be open to the appellant to claim higher rehabilitation for subsequent years if it can substantiate its claim by adducing proper evidence. In addition to these various sums allowed to the appellant by way of prior charges against the gross profits earned during the accounting year the Tribunal also allowed to the appellant Rs. 2.50 lacs by way of provision for debenture redemption fund. The claim of the appellant was for a sum of Rs. 3.50 lacs for the same and it arose under the following circumstances. The appellant had issued debentures of the value of Rs. 30 lacs in the year 1942-43 and they were redeemable in the year 1962-63. No annual provision had been made from profits for redemption of the same inasmuch as until the year 1949 the appellant was not working at a profit. Such provision was made only thereafter. For the year 1950-51, the appellant made a provision for Rs. 75,000 for debenture redemption fund, for 1951.52, Rs. 1,50,000, for 1952-53 Rs. 1,50,000, for 1953-54 Rs. 75,000 and further provision had to be made for redemption of debentures in a sum of Rs. 24,50,000. In so far as 7 more years were left before the due date for redemption the appellant claimed Rs. 3,50,000 as the annual sum to be set apart, though as a matter of fact in the balance-sheet only a provision of Rs. 2,50,000 had been made by it for debenture redemption reserve. The Tribunal pointed out that when the appellant had in its accounts appropriated Rs. 2,50,000 for the debenture redemption fund the claim to have Rs. 3,50,000 for the purposes of bonus formula was clearly untenable. It however was of the opinion that a reasonable provision for redemption fund should be allowed as a prior charge and actually allowed the sum of Rs. 2,50,000 which had been actually provided for the purpose in the balance-sheet, negativing the contention of the respondents that no provision should be allowed for debenture redemption fund in the bonus formula. We are of the opinion that the Tribunal was not justified in allowing the sum of Rs. 2,50,000/- for debenture redemption fund as a prior charge in the bonus calculations. The Full Bench Formula does not envisage any such prior charge. It is no doubt true that capital is shy and it would not be practicable for the industrial concern to raise large amounts by way of fresh debentures when they become due. It is also true that the debentures do not stand on a par with other debts of a concern because the debentureholders would in a conceivable situation be able to enforce their security by bringing the industry to a stand-still by taking over charge of the whole concern. It would therefore appear that the redemption of these debentures would be one of the primary obligations of the industrial concern and due provision has of necessity to be made for redemption thereof on due date. This however does not mean that in the calculations of the distributable surplus the provision for such redemption should be given the status of a prior charge, though of course that would be a relevant con- sideration while distributing the available surplus between the various interests entitled thereto. We are therefore of opinion that the Tribunal was wrong in allowing Rs. 2,50,000/- as a prior charge in the bonus calculations. This disposes of all the contentions which have been urged on behalf of both the parties and calculating the figure on that basis we arrive atthe following Rs. in lacs. Gross Profit as per Tribudals calculations 36.21 Less Notional Normal Depreciation 6.23 29.98 Less Tax 7 as. in a rupee 11.55 18.43 Less 6 return on ordinary share capital and 5 on preference share capital 4.30 14.13 Less 4 Return on reserves used as working capital 7,42,139 29 41,81,196 1.67 --------------------- 49,23,335 1.96 ------------- 12.17 LessProvision for Rehabilitation 0.17 ------------ Available Surplus 12.00 This would bring the available surplusfor distribution to a sum of Rs. 12 lacs and this would be distributable amongst the shareholders, the company and the workmen concerned. It is not feasible to lay down any rigid formula as to what the proportion of such distribution amongst these various interests should be. The shareholders as well as the company would both be naturally interested inter alia in providing the debenture redemption reserves as also meeting the needs of the industry for further expansion. The workmen would no doubt be interested in trying to bridge the gap between their actual wage and the living wage to the extent feasible. This surplus of Rs. 12 lacs would have to be distributed amongst them having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, of course bearing in mind the various considerations indicated above. Before we arrive at the figure of the actual bonus which it will be appropriate in the circumstances of this case to allow to the workmen, we may advert to one argument which was pressed before us. on their behalf and that was that the bonus calculations should not be made on the basis of the All-India figures which were adopted by the Tribunal but on the basis of the actual amounts which the appellant had paid and would have to pay to the workmen concerned. It was pointed out that the respondents here were only the workmen in the Wadala Factory of the appellant. The appellant had, however, paid to the various workmen elsewhere as and by way of bonus sums varying between 4 and 29 of the basic wages for the year in question. The sum of Rs. 1,23,138/- only had been paid in full and final settlement to the workmen in some of the factories and the bonus calculations on an All-India basis would thus work to the advantage of the appellant in so far as they would result in saving to the appellant of the difference between the amounts to which those workmen would be entitled on the basis of the All-India figures adopted by the Tribunal and the amounts actually paid to them as a result of agreements, conciliation or adjudication. It was therefore contended that the calculations should be made after taking into account the savings thus effected by the appellant and only a sum of Rs. 1,23,138 - which was the actual sum paid to those workmen should be taken into account and no more. We are afraid, we cannot accept this contention. If this contention was accepted the respondents before us would have an advantage over those workmen with whom settlements have been made and would get larger amounts by way of bonus merely by reason of the fact that the appellant had managed to settle the claims of those workmen at lesser figures. If this contention of the respondents was pushed to its logical extent it would also mean that in the event of the non-fulfilment of the conditions imposed by the Tribunal in the award of bonus herein bringing in savings in the hands of the appellant, the respondents would be entitled to take advantage of those savings also and should be awarded larger amounts by way of bonus, which would really be the result of the claimants entitled to the same not receiving it under certain circumstances-an event which would be purely an extraneous one and unconnected with the contribution of the respondents towards the gross profits earned by the appellant. The Tribunal was, therefore, right in calculating the bonus on an All-India basis. By our order dated April 12, 1957, the appellant was ordered to pay to the respondents within a fortnight from the date thereof bonus for the year 1954-55 equivalent to two months basic wages that amount has already been paid and works out at Rs. 3.39 lacs on an All-India basis. The only question which therefore survives is what further bonus, if any, would the respondents be entitled to from the distributable surplus of Rs. 12 lacs. The sum of Rs. 3.50 lacs required for building up the debenture redemption reserve is an all-engrossing need of the appellant and that is a factor which must of necessity be taken into consideration while arriving at the ultimate figure, particularly because such redemption of the debentures would enure not only for the benefit of the Company and its shareholders but also of the workmen employed therein. Having regard to all the circumstances of the case, we feel that an award of four months basic wages as aggregate bonus for the year 1954-55 (which by the way was the bonus awarded for the previous year 1953-54 also) would give a fair share to the labour in the distributable surplus, leaving to the shareholders and the company a balance of Rs. 5.22 lacs to be utilised by them not only towards building up of the debenture redemption reserve but also for building up other reserves, which would be utilised for various other purposes indicated above.DECISION ??"
98.0,Labour Dispute,"Appeal by special leave from the Award dated September 13, 1961, of the Second Labour Court, West Bengal, in Case No. VIII-C-40 of 1960. M .C Setalvad, J. B. Dadachanji, O. C. Mathur and Ravinder Narain, for the appellant. K. Daphtary, Solicitor General of India and Janardhan Sharma, for the respondent No. 1 1963. February 15. The judgment of the Court was delivered by GAJENDRAGADKAR J.--Mr. R. K. Banerjee had been employed by the appellant, the Tata Oil Mills Co. Ltd.as a Salesman on April 3, 1956, as a probationer and he was confirmed on November 5, 1956. On December 5, 1959, his services were terminated and he was informed that the appellant had lost confidence in him, and so, it bad decided to discharge him. Accordingly, in lieu of notice, he was paid a months salary and was told that he ceased to be the employee of the appe- llant as from the date next after he received the order from the appellant. The discharge of Mr. Banerjee was resented by the Union to which he belonged and the Union took up his case. Since the dispute could not be settled amicably, the Union succeeded in persuading the Government of West Bengal to refer the dispute for adjudication to the Second Labour Court on the ground that the said discharge was not justified. That is how the discharge of Mr. Banerjee became an industrial dispute between the appellant and the respondents, its workmen represented by their Union. The Labour Court which tried the dispute came to the conclusion that the appellant had failed to justify the discharge of Mr. Banerjee and so, it has directed the appellant to reinstate him and pay him full emoluments from the date of his discharge up to the date of his reinstatement. It is this order which is challenged by the appellant by its present appeal brought to this Court by special leave. The material facts leading to the termination of Mr. Banerjees services lie within a very narrow compass. in November, 1959 Mr. Banerjee was working in the Assam area and as such, had to work as a Salesman at Dhubri, Bongaigoan, Rangia and Tejpur. The appellant expected that as its Salesman Mr. Banerjee should visit dealers in his area and carry on intelligent and intensive propaganda to popularise the sale of the appellants products. The appellant has a Sales ice in Calcutta and the manager of the said ice visits the areas within his jurisdiction to inspect the work of Salesmen. Accordingly Mr. Gupta who was then the manager of the Calcutta ice visited the area assigned to Mr. Banerjee, in the last week of October. He found that Mr. Banerjee was networking satisfactorily as a Salesman. In particular, he noticed that whereas Mr. Banerjee had reported to the ice that the Bongaigoan Stockists had 20 boxes of dried up and deshaped 501 Special Soap which could not be distributed in the market he had in fact not opened a single box and had not cared to satisfy himself that the soaps had either dried up or had been deshaped. In fact, Mr. Gupta found that the boxes were intact and he opened them and discovered that five boxes contained soap which had dried up and had become deshaped, whereas the 15 other boxes were in good condition. Thereupon, Mr. Gupta made a report to the zonal Manager on November 2, 1959, adversely commenting on Mr. Banerjees work. The said report was in due course forwarded to the Head ice in Bombay. The Head ice then instructed the Calcutta Sales ice by telephone to send for Mr. Banerjee and call for his explanation. Accordingly, Mr. Banerjee was sent for and his explanation taken Mr. Gupta then made another report expressing his dissatisfaction with the explanation given by Mr. Banerjee. This report was sent on November 24, 1959. The Head ice accepted this report and on December 5, 1959, issued to Mr, Banerjee the order terminating his services. That, in brief, is the case set out by the appellant in support of the action taken by it against Mr. Banerjee. The appellant had alleged that the termination of Mr. Banerjees services was not dismissal but was a discharge simpliciter, and according to it, the discharge was justified by the terms of contract between the appellant and Mr. Banerjee as embodied in Rule 40 (1) of the Service Rules of -the appellant. The appellant, therefore, urged that the Labour Court had no jurisdiction to consider the propriety of the appellants action in discharging Mr. Banerjee. The respondents, on the other hand, contended that the discharge was not discharge simpliciter but was, in substance, dismissal, and so, it was urged that the Labour Court was entitled to consider the propriety of the appellants action. Basing themselves on the plea that the discharge amounted to dismissal, the respondents pleaded that the failure of the appellant to hold an enquiry against Mr. Banerjee introduced a serious infirmity in the order passed against him and they argued that the conduct of the appellant was malafide and the dismissal of Mr. Banerjee amounted to victimisation. The Labour Court has found that according to the terms of contract under which Mr. Banerjee was employed by the appellant, the appellant was entitled to discharge Mr. Banerjee from its employment under Rule 40 (1) of the Service Rules but it held that merely because the order served on Mr. Banerjee purported to be an order of discharge, that would not exclude the jurisdiction of the Labour Court to examine the substance of the matter. In fact, Mr. joshi who appeared for the appellant conceded before the Labour Court that an adjudicating Court can look into the reasons behind the discharge of an employee. That is why evidence was led by- both the parties before the Labour Court. Having considered that evidence, the Labour Court has found that the respondents plea about the mala fides of the appellant was not proved and it held that the termination of Mr. Banerjees services could not be said to amount to an act of victimisation or an unfair labour practice. Even so, it held that the discharge was not justified, and so, it,has directed the appellant to reinstate Mr. Banerjee. It is the validity of this order that is challenged before us by Mi. Setalvad on behalf of the appellant. The true legal position about the Industrial Courts jurisdiction and authority in dealing with cases of this kind is no longer in doubt. It is true that in several cases, contract of employment or provisions in Standing Orders authorise an industrial employer to terminate the service, of his employees. after giving notice for one month or paying salary for one month in lieu of notice, and normally, an employer may, in a proper case, -be entitled to exercise the said power. But where an order of discharge passed by an employer gives rise to an industrial dispute. the form of the order by which the employees services are terminated, would not be decisive industrial adjudication would be entitled to examine the substance of the matter and decide whether the termination is in fact discharge simpli- citer or it amounts to dismissal which has put on the cloak of a discharge simpliciter. If the Industrial Court is satisfied that the order of discharge is punitive, that it is malafide, or that it amounts to victimisation or unfair labour practice, it is competent to the Industrial Court to set aside the order and in a proper case, direct the reinstatement of the employee. In some cases, the termination of the employees services may appear to the Industrial Court to be capricious or so unreasonably severe that an inherence may legitimately and reasonably be drawn that in terminating the services, the employer was not acting bonafide. The test always has to be whether the act of the employer is bonafide or not. If the act is malafide, or appears to be a colourable exercise of the powers conferred on the employer either by the terms of contract or by the standing orders, then notwithstanding the form of the order, industrial adjudication would examine the substance and would direct reinstatement in a fit case. This position was recognised by the Labour Appellate Tribunal as early as 1951 in Buckingham and Carnatic Co. Ltd., v. Workers of the Company, (1), and since then, it has been consistently followed vide Chartered Bank, Bombay, v. Chartered Bank Employees Union (2) , and U. B. Dutt Co. (Private) Ltd. v. Its Workmen (3). In the present case, the Labour Court has made a definite finding in favour of -the appellant that its action in terminating the services of Mr. Banerjee was not malafide and did not amount to victimisation. Even so, it proceeded to examine the propriety of the said action and came to the conclusion that Mr. Banerjees discharge from employment did not appear to it to be justified. In coming to this conclusion, the Labour Court has given some reasons which are clearly unsupportable. It has observed, for instance, that the appellant has not produced any documentary evidence in support of its allegation against the efficiency of Mr. Banerjee. This is clearly wrong because the two reports made by Mr. Gupta in respect of Mr. Banerjees conduct do amount to documentary evidence which cannot be lightly brushed aside. It has then commented on the fact that the allegations made by Mr. Gupta against Mr. Banerjee on six counts are of a general character. This comment again cannot be justified because Mr. Gupta stated in clear terms the defects in Mr. Banerjees work which had come to his notice. These defects are specific and it is idle to refuse to give importance to this evidence merely on the ground that no specific instances had been cited. In regard .to the question as to whether the 20 boxes had been opened by Mr. Banerjee before he made his report (1) (1951) 11 L.L J. 314. (2) (1960) 11 L.L.J. 221. (3) (1962)1 L.L J. 374. to the Zonal ice, the Labour Court has observed that on this point there is the evidence of Mr. Banerjee against that of Mr. Gupta and there was no particular reason to believe one in preference to the other. Now, it is clear that such an -observation is hardly of any help because it was necessary for the Labour Court to express its conclusion on this point it might have believed either Mr. Banerjee or Mr. Gupta, but by saying that there is no reason why one should be believed rather than the other, the Labour Court left this part of the dispute entirely undecided. Similarly, the Labour Court has accepted the fact that Mr. Gupta that called for and received Mr. Banerjees explanation and to that extent it has rejected Mr. Banerjee suggestion that he had not given any explanation a all but even so, the Labour Court has not considered the effect of this conclusion on the main controversy between the parties. In our opinion, therefore, the-reasons given by the Labour Court in support of its conclusion that the discharge of Mr. Banerjee was not justified are wholly unsatisfactory and so, it has become necessary for us to examine the evidence ourselves. The first report made by Mr. Gupta expressly states six grounds on which Mr. Banerjees work was found to be unsatisfactory. Mr. Gupta took the view that Mr. Banerjee was very slow in his work as a Salesman, that he was not able to judge the capacity of the dealers and to give them sufficient stocks in time, that he took no steps to put the products of the appellant on prominent view in the dealers shops, that he wag not looking after the pasting of the posters, in fact in one place the poster was pasted upside down, that he was not educating the stockists and dealers as he could have done and that he was reluctant to put hard and intelligent work. It is remarkable that when Mr. Banerjee was asked about this report in cross-examination, he frankly stated that Mr. Gupta was not unfriendly towards him and he was really unable to say why Mr. Gupta should have made these adverse comments against his work. In fact, the Labour Court itself has found that the appellant was not actuated by any ulterior considerations in discharging Mr. Banerjee. This report was made by Mr. Gupta soon after he inspected Mc. Banerjees work and there is no reason, whatever, why the Labour Court should have been reluctant to accept this report. Confining ourselves to the main complaint against Mr. Banerjee that he had not examined even a single box before he reported that the contents of the said boxes were not marketable, Mr. Gupta expressly stated that he had seen the 20 boxes and found that none of them had been opened at all. They were intact in the companys packing with the straps on them. Mr Gupta got them opened and found that the contents to the extent of 5 cases were really damaged and that the remaining contents were alright and could be marketed at the companys prices. Mr. Banerjee stated in his evidence that he had all the cases opened and he added, as he. had to, that the said cases were repacked for avoiding further deterioration. When he was asked how that could be done, he agreed that the metal straps had to be removed for opening of the boxes, but he added that he had arranged to have them restrapped and nailed. It is clear that the strapping is done in a factory by machines. Mr. Banerjee, however, suggested that he could manage to get the straps put and nailed with hands. This evidence is patently unreliable. Besides, it is significant that when he gave his explanation to Mr. Gupta Mr. Banerjee admitted that he had opened only 5 or 6 out of the 20 boxes in question though his report suggested that he had opened all the 20 boxes. Therefore, there can be no doubt that Mr. Guptas statetment is absolutely true and that Mr. Banerjee had made his report about the unsatisfactory condition of the contents of the 20 boxes without as much as opening any one of them. That being so, it is difficult to understand how the Labour Court could -have come to the conclusion that the order of discharge was not justified. The learned Solicitor-General, however, attempted to argue that there was nothing on the record to show that the 20 boxes which Mr. Gupta got opened were the same boxes in respect of which Mr. Banerjee had made his report. We do not think that having regard to the evidence given by Mr. Gupta and Mr. Banerjee and the explanation offered by the latter when he was called to Calcutta by Mr. Gupta, there is any room for such an ingenious suggestion. Both parties knew that they were talking about the same 20 boxes and so,, it is futile now to suggest that the 20 boxes which Mr. Gupta examined were different from the boxes in respect of which Mr. Banerjee had made his report. It was also suggested on behalf of the respondents that Mr. Gupta did not admit that he had received some letters from Mr. Banerjee in which he had complained that owing to heavy rains, conditions were not favourable for effective work in the area entrusted to him. It is true that when Mr. Gupta was asked about these letters, he said he did not remember if he had received them. We do not think that the answers given by Mr. Gupta in respect of these letters can be of any assistance to the respondents in discrediting Mr. Guptas evidence in any manner. On the whole, we have no hesitation in holding that the appellant acted bonafide in discharging Mr. Banerjees services when it accepted Mr. Guptas report and concurred with his conclusions that the explanation given by Mr. Banerjee was not satisfactory. DECISION ??"
99.0,Labour Dispute, This appeal is directed against judgment dated 3.2.2010 of the Division Bench of the Madras High Court whereby the writ appeal filed by the appellant was dismissed and the order passed by the learned Single Judge negating his challenge to the order of punishment was upheld. The appellant joined service as Junior Assistant in the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission for short the Commission in 1973. He was promoted as Assistant in 1975 and as Assistant Selection Grade in 1988. In February 1990 the appellant was sanctioned unearned leave from 12.2.1990 to 25.2.1990 for private work. During that period P Section of the Commission is said to have directed him to work as Invigilator at Bharathiyar Women Arts College Chennai which was one of the centers for the written examination on 17.2.1990 and 18.2.1990 held for recruitment of Assistant Surgeons. In the examination held on 17.2.1990 six candidates sitting in Hall No76 were given the question papers of the afternoon examination in the morning examination. As soon as the Chief Invigilator Shri Syed Abdul Kareem came to know about this he took back the question papers of the afternoon examination and issued the question papers meant for morning examination. This incident was reported in the newspapers. The Commission took serious view of the matter and got registered a First Information Report. Simultaneously the Controller of Examinations recorded the statement of the Chief Invigilator on 20.2.1990 and 22.2.1990. The same is reproduced below STATEMENT OF SYED ABDUL KAREEM GIVEN TO THE COTROLLER. The following fact are submitted. I was posted as chief Invigilator to conduct examination in Bharathi Arts College for women North Madras on 17.2.90 FN AN and on 18.2.90 FN. I collected the question papers in two bundles one for FN Session and another for AN session at 8.00 A.M from the TNPSC office and took them by Auto to the examination centre. At about 9.50 A.M on 17.2.90 myself with two other invigilators. Mr. Balasubramanian Assistant from D.M.E.s Office and other Mr.Syed Abdul Kareem opened the sealed packet of question paper. The question papers were distributed to all the eight halls which were distributed to the candidates by the invigilators posted in the Halls. But in one of the Halls i.e Hall No 76 where 41 candidates were allotted it was found that after noon question papers were mingled. On hearing the fact I immediately received back 6 question papers from 6 candidates and issued them other question papers intended for fore noon session. These six papers were kept in my personal custody till the end of the examination. When I wanted to inform the facts to the TNPSC office immediately the invigilator Thiru Mahalingam Assistant TNPSC office who was assisting me requested me not to inform since the papers were immediately received back from the candidates. Further he said that the staff attached to TNPSC office who were responsible for this mingling the question papers would be punished and the name of the TNPSC will be spoiled. Since he is a serviced employee of the TNPSC I had to take his advice considering that he is pleading knowing all pros and cons. The after noon question papers bundle was opened at 1.50 p.m on 17.2.1990 by myself and two other invigilators Mr. R. Balan Assistant D.M.Es office and one Mr. N. R. Sundararaman Assistant KCH Madras. These papers were distributed to the candidates at 2 p.m there was no complaint about mingling or shortage of question papers. At the close of examination myself and Thiru Mahalingam with the assistance of two staff of college packed the un used answer papers and unused question papers 64 question papers of FN session and 11 A.N. Session papers and another bundle of 71 AN session papers. While packing a lady sweeper brought certain question papers and handed over to the persons who were packing. Immediately these papers has also been packed along with the balance question papers. During end morning session the six candidates who were served the A.N session question papers were asked to wait and the answer papers were received back and they were requested to be seated in a separate room opposite to the Hall till the commencement of after noon session. The candidates were seated in a small rook till the after session when Tiffin or coffee offered to them they refused to get. The AN session question papers received back from the candidates six in no were kept in my pocket first and then kept in my bag after 2 p.m. Before me Sd Sd Syed Abdul Kareem. Controller of Examinations 20.2.90. In continuation of my statement dated 20.2.90 given to the Controller of Examinations it is further stated that I missed to mention the following facts there in it at about 12.30 p.m. Thiru Gurumoorthy a Member of TNPSC visited the examination centre and met me and enquired about the conduct of the examination. Though I was prepared to inform the Member about the receipt of Mingling of question papers again Mr. Mahalingam stopped me and requested not to tell. After about some time the Member left the centre. At about 3.00 P.M one of the Under Secretaries of the TNPSC office visited the Examination Centre and took a written statement from me. Again I did not inform him the fact of the mingle of the question papers in the morning session at the insistence of the same person Mr. Mahalingm. Though I should have informed the fact to the both the officials but did not do so under the impression that being a senior staff of the TNPSC office Mr. Mahalingam might have had the knowledge of the consequences and he would have known the gravity of the incident I had to take his words. Had he not been posted I would not have been mislead. But on 15.2.90 he visited my office at about 11.30 AM and informed me that he had been posted as Invigilator to Bharathi College for Women where I was posted as Chief Invigilator. He assured me that he would assist me on 16.2.90 after noon also in arranging the examination halls. So he did what he promised and after posting all the other invigilators to various halls I retained Mr. Mahalingam with me to assist so he was with me all along the day till I left the examination centre at about 6.45 pm on 17.2.90. The list of invigilators posted to my centre does not contain the names of the three staff of TNPSC office who were posted as Invigilators. They are Mr. Mahalingam Mr. Sekarao and Mr. Udhaya Kumar. But they are having their individual orders that too they did not handed over to me. I did not ask for any help in writing from the TNPSC office. The absentees statement were also prepared by Mr. Mahalingam only. Before Me. Sd Sd Syed Abdul Kareem. Controller of Examns 22.2.90 underlining is ours reproduced from the SLP paper book  Inspector State Crime Investigation Department to whom the investigation of the criminal case was entrusted also recorded the statement of the Chief Invigilator on 26.2.1990. The relevant portions thereof are extracted below STATEMENT OF SYED ABDUL KAREEM AGE 55 90 S O SYED THASTAGINI NO8 S.R.P.KOIL STREET NORTH THIRU VI.KA.NAGAR MADRAS 82. .. During the month of February 1990 an order from the office of TNPSC came to me on 14.2.90 to conduct the TNPSC Examination for Assistant Medical Officer post on 17.2.90 full day and 18.2.90 half day fore noon only . I went to TNPSC office on 15.2.90 and met the Superintendent of the concerned Section I do not remember his name in person. I told him that I am suffering from heart ailment as such it is not possible for me to conduct the examination and hence made a request to appoint some other person. He told me that this order is passed by District Collector Chennai as such it is not possible for us to do anything and asked me to get the amount by sending a man with me. I got the cheque and came to him and asked a list of persons who are going to assist me. At this time TNPSC gave 19 persons to assist me. But certain persons informed me over phone at G.H that it is not possible for them to assist me. Again I went to the TNPSC Office on 16.2.90 and informed the position to the concerned Superintendent at about 2 noon. He told me that they had posted 5 persons to assist me from their section. Kindly conduct the examination with them and asked his Assistant by name Saveriyar to give me the names of 5 persons in writing. He gave me a list in his hand writing as 1 Udhayakumar 2 Sekaran 3 Mahalingam 4 Aasir and the name of another person not known but know the person. On 16.2.90 Mahalingam came to my office at G.H at 12.00 hours and told me that he is on leave and studying for Group I examination but he will come and assist me. Mahalingam is known to me from the year 1985 86 onwards. On the next day that is on 17.2.90 I went to TNPSC office at 8.00 AM and got two bundles containing question papers by affixing seal on the cloth as 17.2.90 Forenoon 10.00 AM to 12.00 Noon as one bundle and 17.2.90 Afternoon 2.00 PM to 5 PM as another bundle and went Bharathi Womens College in an Auto and reached there at about 8.45 AM. Mahalingam was waiting there 19 persons came there to assist me invigilators . I gave them answer sheets thread and white papers and send them to each and every hall. Then at 9.50 hours I took the question bundle for the forenoon and affixed my signature in the face slip of the said bundle in the presence of two invigilators 1 G.Balasubramaniam Assistant D.M.E Chennai 5 and 2 Aazir School Assistant Thayar Sahib Street Anna Salai Chennai 2 and also got their signature. Then I have ripped the seal of the bundle and got the signature of the said two persons in the paper inside the bundle and I have also put my signature. Then at 10 hours I gave the question papers to invigilators and instructed them to take the question papers to the respective halls. I have appointed Syed Ibrahim and Thiru N.R.Sundararaman as invigilators for hall No76. The said Ibrahim told me that six students told him that the question papers issued to them are for the afternoon examination as it seems that six question papers for the afternoon examination have been found mixed with the question papers for the forenoon examination. Immediately I went to that hall No 76 and made enquiry and came to know it as true. Immediately I got back the afternoon question papers from the six students and issued the question papers for the forenoon. I kept the said six question papers which are intended for the afternoon at my custody. Then I have decided to inform it to TNPSC office and it was written by Mahalingam as per my dictation. Mahalingam told me that if the said letter is sent the staff of TNPSC office will get some trouble that the name of Controller will be spoiled that the said Controller belongs to his community and that he is going to get the post of District Collector shortly. Hence I have not informed it to TNPSC over phone. Mahalingam also turned the letter written by him. He also told me that he had got back the after noon question papers immediately as such there is no possibility for the students to read over it. No problem will arise and pleaded me that do not inform it to any one. Then the examination was going on. I went around all the halls. No complaint received from the students. It was written in the face slip of the forenoon bundle as 410 question papers. On counting it is found 412 question papers. I gave 339 persons from it and out of the remaining 75 64 question papers for forenoon and 9 for the afternoon. I kept the said question papers in a cover. At about 12 Noon one member of TNPSC Mr. Gurumurthi came there. He asked me whether any problem. I asked Mahalingam whether we will inform to him. But Mahalingam told me that it is not necessary to say this now as we have not given any report in the morning itself as such if we say it now it will became a mistake. Hence I have not informed it to him. He saw the afternoon bundle with the seal and he did not verify the forenoon question paper bundle and left away. All the invigilators made a complaint to Gurumurthi that the amount paid to them is not sufficient. He gave a reply that we had already informed about it to the Government. Then at 2.00 PM Mr. Nithyanandam Under Secretary of TNPSC office came there. He also made enquiry about the examination. He got a statement from me. I gave a report as nothing special. At that time at about 1.50 Noon I have opened the afternoon bundle in the presence of 1 Balan and 2 Sundararaman in the face slip it is found as 17.2.90 2.00 PM to 5.00 PM and written as 410 Question papers and I got the signature from both of them and I have also affixed my signature. Then I gave the answer sheets and question papers to the invigilators and send them to the examination hall. Examination was over. There was no problem. At 00 PM I have collected the answer sheets and the remaining question papers. All the invigilators returned except Mahalingam. We made bundle of the answer sheets after counting. I kept the remaining question papers in a cover. At about 6.30 PM the sweeper handed over to me two question papers and I found some scribbling and I have kept that also in a cover and put Seal. I have kept the model question paper given to me in the said cover. Mahalingam went away after putting all these in an Auto. I went to TNPSC Office with Electrician at about 7 PM. The said electrician was working at Bharathi Womens College. One under Secretary was in the upstairs and I do not know his name. I have handed over the bundles to him for which he gave acknowledgement and I got it. I went to TNPSC Office on the next day 18.2.90 at 8.00 AM. They gave me the question papers at 8.20 AM. One Under Secretary came with me in the auto who got the bundles from me on 17.2.90 evening. Then Mahalingam came there and all invigilators came. I have sent the answer sheets to the respective halls. Then at 9.50 AM I have opened the bundle in the presence of two invigilators and the Under Secretary and in the label of the bundle it is written as 18.2.90 Forenoon 10.00 AM to 12 Noon and got the signature of two invigilators and I have also affixed my signature. I do not remember their names. Then I have opened the bundle and after counting it was 410 papers. I gave the required question papers at 10.00 Hours. On that day there was no problem in the examination. At 12.00 Noon 1 have collected the answer sheets made bundle by affixing seal and took it TNPSC office by Auto and handed over it there and got the acknowledgement. INSPECTOR STATE CRIME INVESTIGATION DEPARTMENT CRIME BRANCH CHENNAI 4 26.2.90 underlining is ours reproduced from the SLP paper book 5. After about one month the Commission issued Memorandum dated 27.3.1990 for holding departmental inquiry against the appellant under Rule 17 b of the Tamil Nadu Civil Services Classification Control and Appeal Rules for short the Rules on the following charges 1. That Thiru R. Mahalingam Assistant had gone to the examination hall unauthorisedly on the pretext of assisting the Chief Invigilator while he was on Unearned Leave on Private Affairs. 2. That he had gone to the examination hall and take up the official work and acted as Invigilator while he was on leave. 3. That he had prevented the Chief Invigilator from sending a report to the Controller of Examinations about the distribution of afternoon question paper in the forenoon and the resultant leakage of question paper. In his reply the appellant pointed out that his name did not figure in the first information report got registered with the police and the remand report and that the real culprits had already been apprehended. The appellant also claimed that he was not connected with the leakage of question papers. The copies of two statements made by the Chief Invigilator were not supplied to the appellant and he was asked to make a statement by the Enquiry Officer. In his statement dated 12.10.1990 the appellant denied all the allegations levelled against him. For the sake of reference the appellants statement is reproduced below Charges framed in this office Memorandum No 2316 D5 1990 dated 27.3.90 have been read out to Thiru R. Mahalingam. Question Do you accept the charges Answer No. Three charges were framed against me. I sought time to offer my explanation after filing the charge sheet or receipt of a final police report. My letter seeking permission to offer my explanation refused and directed me to appear for the oral enquiry. Even though I have not preferred for the oral enquiry as directed by the imperative authority of the office I simply obeyed the orders and appeared for the oral enquiry. Question Have you applied leave during February 1990 and if so what kind of leave Ans. I have applied U.E.L on private affairs during February 1990. Que For how many days you have applied UEL on private affairs during February 1990 Ans I do not know. Que Have you got prior permission for the said leave Ans I have applied leave sufficiently in advance. But the leave sanction order was received during my leave period to my home. Que It is reported that you have gone to the examination hall unauthorisedly on the pretext of assisting the Chief Invigilator while you were on unearned leave on private affairs. What do you say about this charge Ans Regarding the first and second charges I wish to inform you that though the charges have been framed on two counts they have been famed so on the sole ground that my presence in the examination hall unauthorized one. Before adverting to the allegations made in charges 1 and 2 I wish to inform you Sir Please refer our office letter No 377 Pl 90 dated 16.2.90 which is a letter appointing me as an Invigilator which was signed and issued by the competent authority. A Xerox copy of the letter is produced. I also found my name in the list sent to the Chief Invigilator. The chief Invigilator verified the list with the appointment letter issued by the office and permitted me to act as Invigilator. Que Have you received the appointment order by post or in person Ans I have received in person. Que For what reason you have come to office though you were on leave at that time Ans I used to visit University Library during my leave period I have also happened to visit to office to see whether any letter was received to my name. Que At the examination hall what kind of work was allotted to you by the chief Invigilator And I have been instructed to do the distribution of main and additional answer books and collection of answer books from each hall except question papers. Que Have you been allotted to the work of distribution of question paper to each hall Ans No. Que What do you say about charge 3 framed against you Ans I have nothing to say about the charge No3 since the office in its Memorandum dated 11.10.90 has stated to the effect that enquiry by the Police in connection with the leakage of question papers Assistant Surgeon recruitment is going on separately whereas departmental action has been taken against him mainly for his having unauthorisedly acted as Invigilator while he was on leave. Que Do you want personal hearing besides oral enquiry Ans No Que Whether you want to say anything more about the charges Ans Yes. Three charges were framed. First two charges are one and the same for which I have given authoritative evidence. For the third charge i.e resultant leakage of question paper was referred to police for investigation. Moreover the third charge has not been pressed in the office Memorandum dated 11.10.90. When I moved the court for anticipatory bail it was stated before the Court in the counter affidavit that the Petitioner was interrogated in connection with mixing of question paper and not to the leakage of question paper. Secondly when I was seeking permission to officer my explanation in my letter dated 22.8.90 it was misconstrued by the office that I have submitted my explanation vide its letter dated 11.9.90. In my letter dated 18.9.90 to furnish a copy of my explanation the office in its letter dated 11.10.90 it has been stated that I have failed to submit the explanation. In my letter dated 18.9.90 I have also requested to state the provision of rules relating to departmental action has nothing to do with the filing of charge sheet or receipt of police report in the matter relating to leakage of question papers. This has not been informed to me. Again in my letter dated 22.8.90 I requested the office to state whether the proposed enquiry is in super session of the earlier orders of the office calling for an explanation or it is part and parcel of these orders calling for an explanation or it is a separate one nothing to do with the charges. My request has not been answered. In the charge memorandum framed against Thiru Savariar it was stated how the appointment order was issue to him even though he was on leave. Hence the office is fully aware that my presence in the examination hall was authorized one. A notice of the proposed enquiry was given only a day in advance. Ample opportunity was not given. Que Are you satisfied with the opportunity given to you during enquiry to defend your case Ans So far as the conduct of the oral enquiry is concerned I am fully satisfied. Sd R. Mahalingam reproduced from the SLP paper book  Thereafter the Enquiry Officer submitted report holding the appellant guilty of all the charges. A copy of the enquiry report was made available to the appellant and he was asked to submit further written statement of defence. In reply the appellant submitted representation dated 21.11.1990 and prayed that he may be allowed to submit further written statement of defence either after filing of chargesheet by the police or receipt of the detailed police report. He submitted another representation on 4.2.1991 to the Deputy Secretary Admn of the Commission. The same reads as under To The Deputy Secretary Admn Madras 600002 TNPSC Madras 600002 Dated 4th Feb 1991. Sir Sub Establishment TNPSC R. Mahalingam Assistant Disciplinary Action. Ref This office Memorandum No 2316 D5 90 dated 11.1.1991. Kindly refer to the report of the enquiry officer which appears to have been made out entirely relying upon the report Dated 22nd February 1990 of the Chief Invigilator miserably superseding the factual evidences deposed by me at the oral enquiry. While the Chief Invigilator was apparently not at all interrogated in regard to the correctness of his statement the credibility of his report is doubtful. As such the report of the Enquiry officer which is entirely based upon it is seemingly questionable and appears arbitrary too. However to enable me to defend the charges a copy of the report of the Chief Invigilator may kindly be furnished to me. Further to back up my statement that the Chief Invigilator before permitting me to take up the Invigilation Duty did verify with his papers and records and ticked against my name found therein among other personnel of the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission appointed as Invigilators by the Office viz. Thiruvalargal M. Segaran and Udhayakumar a copy preferably Xerox copy of the list of Invigilators sent to the Chief Invigilator may kindly be obtained from the Chief Invigilator and furnished to me. On receipt of the above copies of the records I shall submit my statement to defend the charges as called for in the reference cited. Thanking you Yours faithfully Sd R. Mahalingam. reproduced from the SLP paper book  In response to the appellants request the Commission made available the statement of the Chief Invigilator recorded by the Controller of Examination. After receiving the same the appellant submitted application dated 18.4.1991 to the Deputy Secretary Administration for grant of permission to cross examine the Chief Invigilator the officer of the Commission in whose presence request is sought to have been made to the Chief Invigilator not to report the matter to the Commission and the person who appointed him along with others as Invigilators. He also submitted representation dated 20.5.1991 to the Chairman of the Commission and sought his intervention for ensuring compliance of the rules of natural justice. However without waiting for the decision of his representations the Secretary of the Commission passed order dated 10.10.1991 and imposed punishment of removal from service. The departmental appeal filed by the appellant was dismissed by the Chairman of the Commission vide order dated 14.8.1992. He reiterated the findings recorded by the Enquiry Officer and the Secretary that the appellant had unauthorisedly done the work of Invigilator and prevented the Chief Invigilator from reporting the matter to the Commission. The appellant challenged the order of punishment and the appellate order in Writ Petition No19251 1992 but could not convince the learned Single Judge to quash orders dated 10.10.1991 and 14.8.1992. The writ appeal filed by him was dismissed by the Division Bench of the High Court which expressed concurrence with the learned Single Judge that the enquiry was held against the appellant in consonance with the rules of natural justice and the findings recorded by the Enquiry Officer were based on proper analysis of the records produced during the enquiry. We have heard learned counsel for the parties. The scope of judicial review in matters involving challenge to the disciplinary action taken by the employer is very limited. The Courts are primarily concerned with the question whether the enquiry has been held by the competent authority in accordance with the prescribed procedure and whether the rules of natural justice have been followed. The Court can also consider whether there was some tangible evidence for proving the charge against the delinquent and such evidence reasonably supports the conclusions recorded by the competent authority. If the Court comes to the conclusion that the enquiry was held in consonance with the prescribed procedure and the rules of natural justice and the conclusion recorded by the disciplinary authority is supported by some tangible evidence then there is no scope for interference with the discretion exercised by the disciplinary authority to impose the particular punishment except when the same is found to be wholly disproportionate to the misconduct found proved or shocks the conscience of the Court. Having noticed the parameters laid down by this Court for exercise of the power of judicial review in such matters we shall now consider whether the appellant has succeeded in showing that the High Court committed an error by declining his prayer for quashing the order of punishment. Rule 8 of the Rules specifies various penalties including dismissal from service which can be imposed on a member of the Civil Service of the State or a person holding Civil Post under the State. Rule 17 b which contains the procedure for holding enquiry reads as under 17 a xxx xxx xxx b i Without prejudice to the provisions of the Public Servants Inquiries Act 1850 Central Act XXXVII of 1850 in every case where it is proposed to impose on a member of a service or on a person holding a Civil Post under the State any of the penalties specified in items iv vi vii and viii in rule 8 the grounds on which it is proposed to take action shall be reduced to the form of a definite charge or charges which shall be communicated to the person charged together with a statement of the allegation on which each charge is based and of any other circumstances which it is proposed to take into consideration in passing orders on the case. He shall be required within a reasonable time to put in a written statement of his defence and to state whether he desires an oral inquiry or to be heard in person or both. An oral inquiry shall be held if such an inquiry is desired by the person charged or is directed by the authority concerned. Even if a person charged has waived an oral inquiry such inquiry shall be held by the authority concerned in respect of charges which are not admitted by the person charged and which can be proved only through the evidence of witnesses. At that inquiry oral evidence shall be heard as to such of the allegations as are not admitted and the person charged shall be entitled to cross examine the witnesses to give evidence in person and to have such witnesses called as he may wish provided that the officer conducting the inquiry may for special and sufficient reason to be recorded in writing refuse to call a witness. Whether or not the person charged desired or had an oral inquiry he shall be heard in person at any stage if he so desires before passing of final orders. A report of the inquiry or personal hearing as the case may be shall be prepared by the authority holding the inquiry or personal hearing whether or not such authority is competent to impose the penalty. Such report shall contain a sufficient record of the evidence if any and a statement of the findings and the grounds thereof. Whenever any inquiring authority after having heard and recorded the whole or any part of the evidence in an inquiry ceases to exercise jurisdiction therein and is succeeded by another inquiring authority which has and which exercises such jurisdiction the inquiring authority so succeeding may act on the evidence so recorded by its predecessor or partly recorded by its predecessor and partly recorded by itself Provided that if the succeeding inquiring authority is of the opinion that further examination of any of the witnesses whose evidence has already been recorded is necessary in the interest of justice it may recall examine cross examine and re examine any such witnesses as hereinbefore provided  ii After the inquiry or personal hearing referred to in clause i has been completed the authority competent to impose the penalty specified in that clause is of the opinion on the basis of the evidence adduced during the inquiry that any of the penalties specified therein should be imposed on the Government Servant it shall make an order imposing such penalty and it shall not be necessary to give the person charged any opportunity of making representation on the penalty proposed to be imposed xxx xxx xxx An analysis of the above reproduced rule makes it clear that holding of an oral enquiry is sine qua non for recording a finding by the enquiring authority and the report of enquiry must contain sufficient record of evidence and statement of the findings together with grounds thereof. The main allegations leveled against the appellant were that he had unauthorisedly worked as Invigilator and prevented the Chief Invigilator Syed Abdul Kareem from sending report about the incident involving mixing of the question papers of two sessions. On behalf of the Commission oral evidence is said to have been adduced to substantiate the allegations leveled against the appellant but neither the report of the Enquiry Officer nor the orders passed by the Secretary and the Chairman of the Commission make a mention of that evidence. As a matter of fact neither of them relied upon the same for recording a finding of guilty against the appellant. Rather the Enquiry Officer and the two authorities relied upon the portions of the statement made by the Chief Invigilator before the Controller of Examinations and the Inspector completely ignoring that it was he who had asked for substitute Invigilators because those already nominated had conveyed their unwillingness to work and that in the statements made before the Controller of Examinations and the Inspector Crime Investigation Department the Chief Invigilator categorically stated that the appellant had produced the order by which he had been nominated to work as Invigilator and he had no role in bringing the question papers from the office of the Commission or distribution thereof. Unfortunately the learned Single Judge and the Division Bench of the High Court failed to take cognizance of the admission made by the Chief Invigilator that on a request made by him five substitute Invigilators including R.Mahalingam had been appointed by P Section of the Commission and he had produced the order of his appointment and that the question papers etc had been brought by him i.e the Chief Invigilator from the office of the Commission and opened seals in the presence of two other invigilators . The High Court also did not pay due weightage to the fact that the appellant had not handled the question papers at any stage and he had no role in distribution of wrong question papers to six candidates. These errors and omissions on the part of the learned Single Judge and the Division Bench in our considered view are fatal to their concurrence with the finding recorded by the Enquiry Officer the Secretary and the Ch
100.0,Land Dispute,"CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION Appeal (Civil Appeal No. 57 of 1950) from a judgment and decree of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay dated 1st April, 1948, in Appeal No. 365 of 1947 reversing a judgment of the Joint Civil Judge at Ahmedabad, dated 14th October, 1947, in Suit No. 174 of 1945. Somayya (Jindra Lal, with him) for the appel- lants. K. Daphtary (Sri Narain Andley, with him) for the respondents. 1951. February 23. The judgment of the Court was deliv- ered by MAHAJAN J. - The appellants are owners of a property known as Bharat Bhuvan Theatre at Ahmedabad. The respond- ents are the lessees of the said theatre. The term of the lease was to expire on the 2nd December, 1945, unless the lessees gave to the land lords three months previous notice in writing of their intention of exercising their option of renewal of the lease for a further period of two years. On the 13th December, 1945, the appellants filed the suit out of which this appeal arises for ejectment of the respondents and for recovery of certain amounts. This suit was decreed on the 14th October, 1947, on the following findings (1) that the respondents had not exercised the option of the renewal of the lease according to the stipulations contained in the lease, (2) that they had committed breaches of the terms of the lease, and (3) that they were not protected by the Rent Restriction Act. An enquiry was directed into the amount of mesne prof- its. The respondents filed an append in the High Court against the decree of the Joint Civil Judge on the 10th November, 1947. The appeal was heard by a Bench of the High Court (Weston and Dixit JJ.) on the 26th February, 1948, and was decided on the 1st April, 1948. The judgment and decree of the Joint Civil Judge were reversed and the plaintiffs suit was dismissed. The High Court affirmed the finding of the trial court on the first point and held in agreement with it that the respondents had not proved that they gave three months previous notice in writing to the appellants for renewal of the lease as required by clause 4 (2) of the lease. It reversed the finding of the trial Judge on the point that the respondents had committed breaches of the terms contained in clause 2 (20) of the lease. Finally, it reached the conclusion that although the decree appealed from was right on the date it was made, yet in view of the altered circumstances created by reason of coming into operation of Act LVII of 1947 the appellants were not enti- tled to recovery of possession of the suit premises. Being aggrieved by the judgment of the High Court, the appellants obtained a certificate and filed an appeal in this court on the 7th March, 1949, and it is now before us for decision. It was contended before the High Court that the appeal being in the nature of a rehearing, it should be decided in accordance with the provisions of Act LVII of 1947 which came into force on the 13th February, 1948, and not in accordance with the provisions of the Act in force at the time when the decree was passed by the trial court. In other words, the contention was that there having been a change in the law after the date of the decree passed by the trial Judge and before the appeal was heard, the rights of the parties should be determined in accordance with the law as it stood on the date of the hearing of the appeal. The High Court gave effect to this contention and set aside the decree made for ejectment of the respondents. Learned counsel for the appellants challenged the deci- sion of the High Court before us on three grounds (1) that assuming that the appeal had to be decided by the High Court in accordance with the provisions of Act LVII of 1947, the provisions of that Act had no application to pending ap- peals which had been excluded from its ambit (9,)that Act LVII of 1947 had been amended by Bombay Act III of 1949 and that the appeal pending in this court should be decided in accordance with the provisions of the amended Act which excluded pending appeals from the purview of Act LVII of 1947 and (3) that the High Court wrongly reversed the trial courts finding that the respondents had committed breaches of the terms contained in clause 2 (20) of the lease. The learned counsel for the respondents besides controverting the contentions raised on behalf of the appellants contended that both the courts had erred in holding that the respondents had not proved that they exer- cised the option of renewal of the lease according to the stipulations contained therein. In our opinion, the decision of the appeal depends solely on the construction of sections 12 and 50 of Act LVII of 1947. The question to decide is whether the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act, LVII of 1947, which was enacted on the 19th January, 1948, and which came into force on the 13th February, 1948, has applica- tion to pending appeals or whether its retrospective effect is limited to cases mentioned in section 50 of the Act. The point whether the option of renewal was exercised according to the covenants of the lease is concluded by a concurrent finding of fact and nothing that Mr. Daphthary said in support of his contention in any way shakes that finding. The case must therefore be decided on the assump- tion that the respondents did not exercise the option given to them under the lease for its renewal. We are also not impressed with the argument of the learned counsel for the appellants that the High Court wrongly reversed the finding of the trial Judge on the point that the respondents commit- ted breaches of the terms of the tease. We should not howev- er be taken to concur in all the reasons given by the High Court for reversing that finding. Whether the High Court was right in holding that the provisions of Act LVII of 1947 have application to appeals pending at the time when that Act came into force the answer to this question depends on the construction to be placed on sections 12 and 50 of Act LVII of 1947. Section 12 of the Act is in these terms-  A landlord shall not be entitled to the recovery of possession of any premises so long as the tenant pays, or is ready and willing to pay, the amount of the standard rent and permitted increases, if any, and observes and performs the other conditions of the tenancy, in so far as they are consistent with the provisions of this Act.  No suit for recovery of possession shall be insti- tuted by a landlord against a tenant on the ground of non- payment of the standard rent or permitted increases due, until the expiration of one month next after notice in writing of the demand of the standard rent or permitted increases has been served upon the tenant in the manner provided in section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882. No decree for eviction shall be passed in any such suit if, at the hearing. of the suit, the tenant pays or tenders in court the standard rent or permitted increases then due together with the costs of the suit.  Explanation--In any case where there is a dispute as to the amount of standard rent or permitted increases recovera- ble under this Act the tenant shall be deemed to be ready and willing to pay such amount if, before the expiry of the period of one month after notice referred to in sub-section (2), he makes an application to the court under sub-section (3) of section 11 and thereafter pays or tenders the amount or rent or permitted increases specified in the order made by the court. This is the substantive section giving protection to the tenant against ejectment.  Section 50 which occurs in Part IV dealing with miscellaneous matters is the repeal section. It repeals the Act of 1939 and the Act of 1944, and while repealing these statutes it provides as follows-- Provided that all suits and proceedings (other than execution proceedings and appeals) between a landlord and a tenant relating to the recovery or fixing of rent or posses- sion of any premises to which the provisions of Part II apply and all suits and proceedings by a manager of a hotel or an owner of a lodging house against a lodger for the recovery of charges for, or possession of, the accommodation provided in a hotel or lodging house situate in an area to which Part III applies, which are pending in any Court, shall be transferred to and continued before the courts which would have jurisdiction to try such suits or proceed- ings under this Act, and thereupon all the provisions of this Act and the rules made thereunder shall apply to all such suits and proceedings.  Provided further that-- (a) every order passed or act done by the Control- lers under Part IV of the Bombay Rents, Hotel Rates and Lodging House Rates (Control) Act, 1944, and every order or act deemed to have been passed or done under that Part shall be deemed to have been passed or done under this Act and (b) all proceedings pending before the Controllers under Part IV of that Act shall be transferred to and continued before the Controllers appointed under this Act as if they were proceedings instituted before the Con- trollers under this Act The High Court held that section 50 merely provided for transfer of pending suits and proceedings to courts given jurisdiction under the Act to hear them and that from its ambit execution proceedings and appeals were excluded be- cause no question could arise of their being transferred from one court to another and that an appeal being a contin- uation of the suit and in the nature of a re-hearing, the provisions of section 12 should be applied to pending ap- peals.  The opinion expressed by the Division Bench on the construction of sections 12 and 50 of the Act was questioned in Nilkanth v. Rasiklal (J), and the matter was referred to a Full Bench. The Full Bench overruled the decision reached by the Division Bench on the construction of section 50 and observed that it was clear that in terms the provi- sions of the new Act and the rules made thereunder are made to apply only to such suits and proceedings which are trans- ferred under the provisions of this section and that its retrospective effect is confined to what is expressly stated in section 50 of the Act.  We are in respectful agreement with the view expressed by the Full Bench. On a plain reading of the language of sections 12 and 50 it seems clear to us that the Act was given retrospective operation only to a limited extent and execution proceedings and appeals were excluded from this effect and were to be governed by the provisions of the law in force at the time when the decrees were passed. The concluding words of section 50 and there- upon all the provisions of this Act and the rules made thereunder shall apply to all such suits and proceedings fully bear out this construction. Mr. Daphthary contended that the whole object of section 50 was to make provision for transfer of pending cases to courts which were given jurisdiction under the Act to hear them and the section did not concern itself with the extent of the retrospective operation of the Act, and that section 12 of the Act which gives protection to tenants should  A. I. R. 1949 Bom. 210. be construed as having retrospective effect. In our opinion this contention is not sound. Section 50 cannot be de- scribed as a section providing merely for transfer of pend- ing cases to courts having jurisdiction to deal with them. It is on the other hand a repeal section in the new stat- ute.  It repeals the two earlier statutes, and while repeal- ing them it provides that the repeal shall not affect executions and appeals and that the provisions of the Act shall apply to all pending suits which shall be transferred to the courts having jurisdiction to hear them under section 28 of the Act. We are also inclined to agree with the view of the Full Bench that section 12 is in terms prospective and not retrospective. Sub-section (2) clearly relates to suits which may be instituted after the Act comes into force.  It cannot apply to suits which were already pending when the Act was put on the statute book. Sub-section (3) which gives the right to the tenant to pay or tender the rent at the hearing of the suit only applies to those suits which may be instituted after the Act comes into operation because it in terms states in such suit and not in any suit. Such suit can only be a suit referred to in subsec- tions (2) and (3) of section 12. DECISION ??"
101.0,Land Dispute,"Fazl Ali, J. The principal question for determination in this appeal is whether a certain lease had validly terminated by efflux of time or whether there was holding over by the lessee of the leasehold property as contemplated in section 116 of the Transfer of Property Act. The circumstances under which this question and several subsidiary questions to which reference will be made later have arisen may be briefly stated as follows  The Province of Bengal, (hereinafter referred to as the respondent No. 1 or plaintiff) is admittedly the owner of an area of 1125 bighas and odd of land in village Akra. On the 17th February, 1928, the respondent No. 1 executed a lease (exhibit 3) in respect of the said land for 10 years for manufacture of bricks in favour of the appellant, at a rental of Rs. 6,000 a year. The lease was to commence from the 24th February, 1928, and a years rent was payable in advance. By the terms of the said lease, the lessee was prohibited from assigning or subletting the premises or any part thereof without the consent of the lessor except to a limited company and the lease also contained a general provision that the lessee would at the expiration of the lease restore to the lessor the demised premises in as good condition as it was at the date of the lease, reasonable wear and tear excepted. Two further clauses in the lease, which are material for the decision of this appeal, may be reproduced verbatim -  Clause 11 of Part I of the Schedule. The Secretary of State reserves the right to terminate the lease at any time subject to six months notice in the event of the lessees failing to observe and duly perform the conditions hereinbefore and after mentioned and it is hereby agreed that the lessee shall before the expiration or prior termination of the lease hereby granted remove his boilers engines trucks kilns railway and tram lines bricks tools and plant and all other materials whatsoever and yield up the said demised premises unto the Secretary of State and that those bricks tools and plant and other materials that shall not be removed before such expiration or prior termination shall become the property of the Secretary of State. Clause 1 of Part III of the Schedule. The lessee shall be at liberty to keep on the said premises hereby demised for three months after the expiration or prior termination of the term of this lease any bricks boilers engines trucks kilns railway and tram lines and all other materials whatsoever as may have been manufactured by him in the premises in accordance with the conditions of these presents but any bricks and other materials left in contravention to this condition shall become the absolute property of the Secretary of State without payment. It may be stated here that at the time of the execution of the lease, the lessee had purchased from the lessor for Rs. 50,000 all the boilers, engines, trucks, kilns, railway and tramway lines and all other movable property, plant and machinery on the demised premises. The case of the respondent No. 1, who is the plaintiff in the present litigation, is that the appellant (defendant No. 1) had, in contravention of the terms of the lease, sublet the brickfield to defendants-respondents 2 to 18 without the consent of respondent No. 1, and they had caused serious damage to the brickfield in general and failed to maintain the embankments, sluices, etc. in proper repair resulting in a total loss of Rs. 16,840. It was further alleged that the defendants had refused to deliver possession though the lease had terminated, and they had not removed the bricks, pugmills and other materials within 3 months from the termination of the lease. On these allegations, the respondent No. 1 prayed for the following reliefs -  (a) a decree for ejectment and khas possession over the brickfield  (b) damages amounting to Rs. 4,000 for the period between the termination of the lease and institution of the suit and mesne profits for the subsequent period  (c) a decree for Rs. 16,840 for damages caused to the field and  (d) a decree for permanent injunction restraining the defendants from removing or otherwise disposing of the bricks, pugmils, etc. which were claimed to have become the property of the plaintiff. The suit was contested by the appellants, and the other defendants, and their defence was that the appellants had held over with the implied consent of respondent No. 1, and hence the lease had not validly terminated, that no damage or injury had been caused to the land, that the respondent No. 1 was not entitled to forfeit the properties of the appellants lying in the brickfield inasmuch as the term in the lease to that effect was by way of penalty and as such unenforceable, and that the respondent No. 1 was not entitled to the relief of injunction. The trial Judge by his judgment dated the 24th November, 1941, held that there was no holding over with the assent of the plaintiff and both parties were under a mistaken belief that the lease had expired on the 23rd February, 1938. He however held that the evidence did not show that there was any damage or injury caused to the property.  On these findings, the suit was decreed in part, and the respondent No. 1 was directed to be put in possession of the brickfield and was also granted a decree for Rs. 4,000 as mesne profits up to the date on which the respondent No. 1 was put in possession. The prayer for damages for injury alleged to have been caused to the field and the prayer for injunction were however disallowed. The trial Judge allowed the appellants 3 months time to remove their belongings from the Akra brickfield including kilns, pugmills, bricks, coals and any other brick-making material that may be lying there after this period these properties, if any, left in the field. Were to become the absolute properties of the plaintiff. The appellants thereafter preferred an appeal to the High Court at Calcutta, and the respondent No. 1 also preferred a cross-objection claiming that the prayer for injunction should have been allowed and the claim for damages should have been decreed in full. The learned Judges of the High Court who heard the appeal, by their judgment dated the 13th February, 1948, dismissed the appellants appeal and allowed the cross-objection of the respondent No. 1 in part. They held that on the facts established in the case there was no holding over, and that the clause in the lease stating that if the appellants did not remove the bricks etc. from the field within 3 months after the termination of the lease they would become the property of respondent No. 1, was not a clause by way of penalty and should be given effect to. They further held that the claim of respondent No. 1 for damages for injury caused to the demised premises was not established. The present appeal is directed against the judgment of the High Court. The admitted facts of the case are briefly these. The appellants duly paid Rs. 6,000 as rent to respondent No. 1 in February, 1928. In February, 1929, a sum of Rs. 6,714 and odd was paid by the appellants as rent for the period 17th February, 1929, to the 31st March, 1930, and thereafter they continued to pay Rs. 6,000 as rent for the yearly period, 1st April to 31st March of the succeeding year, and the last payment was made in April, 1937, by means of a cheque sent with a covering letter, the material portion of which runs as follows - We beg to enclose herewith a cheque for Rs. 6,000 in payment of rent Akra brickfield for the year 1937-38 ending 31st March, 1938, and shall thank you to please favour us with your formal receipt for the above. The cheque was duly cashed and the amount was entered in the cash book of the plaintiff in the following terms - 5-4-37 (date of receipt). Received without prejudice from Karnani Industrial Bank Ltd. on account of yearly rent for Akra brickfield for the year ending 31st March, 1938. On the 27th August, 1937, the appellants applied to the Secretary to the Government of Bengal, Public Works Department, for renewing the lease for a further period of 10 years, but no reply was received to that letter. After addressing several other letters, the appellants received a letter dated the 23rd February, 1938, with which was enclosed a copy of an extract from a letter addressed by the Executive Engineer, Suburban Division to the Assistant Engineer, No. III Sub-division, which was as under - He is requested to make arrangements with Messrs.  Karnani Industrial Bank Limited for vacant possession of the Akra brickfield on the 24th instant as the lease with the Bank will expire on the 23rd instant according to the terms of the agreement. Ultimately, on the 17th March, 1938, the appellants received the following communication from the Excecutive Engineer, Suburban Division - I would inform you that it is not the intention of Government in this Department to lease out the brickfields and arrangement is being accordingly made to make over the lands to the Government in the Revenue Department for disposal. In a subsequent letter dated the 14th September, 1938, the Executive Engineer wrote to the appellants as follows - I am instructed to state that Government have decided that you cannot be allowed to continue in occupation of the premises any further However, as a matter of grace Government will allow you time till the 30th day of September next, to dismantle the kilns and to remove all your bricks, boiler etc. from the site, on which date Government will take over possession of the property from you. The correspondence to which reference has been made does not show that at any point of time the plaintiff had assented to the appellants continuance of possession. On the other hand, some of the letters written by the appellants show that, notwithstanding their having paid rent up to the 31st March, 1938, they had proceeded all along on the footing that the lease was to expire in February, 1938. For instance, in the appellants letter of the 23rd August, 1937, it is stated we are desirous of renewing the lease of the brickfield for a further period of 10 years from the date of the expiration of the period of the lease dated 17-2-1928. Again, in the letter dated the 23rd October, 1937, reference is made to the appellants application for renewal of the lease for a further period of 10 years on its expiry. Even in the letter which was written on behalf of the appellants on the 3rd March, 1938, after the expiry of the date on which the lease was to terminate, the statement made in the earlier letters was repeated, and it was further stated we applied for renewal of the lease on the 23rd August, 1937, six months prior to the date of expiration of the lease. In this letter, it is nowhere suggested that the appellants were holding over by reason of the acceptance of rent up to the 31st March, 1938. On the other hand, at the end of this letter, we find the following statement - We therefore pray that if the Government is not at all inclined to renew the lease, time may be granted to us for dismantling and removing till the end of December, 1938, and we shall pay the proportional rent to the Government for seven months time in pursuance of the terms of the lease. The reference to the period of 7 months shows that it was assumed that the lease had expired in February, 1938. The letters written on behalf of the Government point to the same conclusion, namely, that both the parties were acting on the assumption that the lease was to expire on the 23rd February, 1938. For instance in a letter written on behalf of the Government on the 25th February, 1938, the following statement is made - I have the honour to inform you that none of your agents was present at the Akra brickfield today as previously arranged to make over the possession of the brickfields. You are therefore requested to please inform me about as to what arrangements are being made by you to make over the possession of the said brickfield to this department. The term of lease expires on the afternoon of the 23rd February, 1938. Apart from the fact that the appellants did not set up in any of their letters a case of holding over, we have to see whether the plea can be said to have been successfully made out by them. There is no doubt that the appellants have established that the rent was paid on their behalf up to the 31st March, 1938, and it was accepted by the respondent No. 1. It has also been established that this payment was made by a cheque and that cheque has been cashed by the Government. Section 116 of the Transfer of Property Act, on which reliance was placed on behalf of the appellants, runs as follows - If a lessee or underlessee of property remains in possession thereof after the determination of the lease granted to the lessee, and the lessor or his legal representative accepts rent from the lessee or under-lessee, or otherwise assents to his continuing in possession, the lease is, in the absence of an agreement to the contrary, renewed from year to year, or from month to month, according to the purpose for which the property is leased  This section was construed by the Federal Court in K. B. Capadia v. Bai Jerbai Warden and Another 1959 F.C.R. 262, and it was held that where rent was accepted by the landlord after the expiration of the tenancy by efflux of time, section 116 applied even though the landlord accepted the amount remitted to him as part deposit towards his claim for compensation for illegal use and occupation, and without prejudice to his rights. It is to be noted that in that case rent had been accepted after the expiry of the tenancy. In our judgment, the present case cannot be governed by that decision, because of the fact, which in our opinion is important that here the payment of rent up to the 31st March, 1938, was made not after the date of expiry of the lease, but on the 5th April, 1937, nearly a year before the expiry of the lease. A reference to section 116 of the Transfer of Property Act will show that for the application of that section, two things are necessary - (1) the lessee should be in possession after the termination of the lease and (2) the lessor or his representative should accept rent or otherwise assent to his continuing in possession. The use of the word otherwise suggests that acceptance of rent by the landlords has been treated as a form of his giving assent to the tenants continuance of possession. There can be no question of the lessee continuing in possession until the lease has expired, and the context in which the provision for acceptance of rent finds a place clearly shows that what is contemplated is that the payment of rent and its acceptance should be made at such a time and in such a manner as to be equivalent to the landlord assenting to the lessee continuing in possession. Both the courts below, after dealing with the matter elaborately, have concurrently held that in the circumstances of the case the consent of respondent No. 1 to the appellants continuing in possession cannot be inferred, and we agree with this finding.  It was pointed out to us on behalf of the respondent that the entry relating to this payment in the books of the plaintiff contains the words received without prejudice from Karnani Industrial Bank The same words however occur in several earlier entries, and we are not inclined to attach any special significance to them. But it seems to us that the very fact, that the payment was made at a time when there was no question of the lessor assenting to the lessees continuing in possession and neither party treated the payment as importing such assent, is sufficient to take the case out of the mischief of section 116 of the Transfer of Property Act. There is also another view which we think is possible to take upon the facts of the case. As we have seen the rent for the first year was paid in advance near about the time of the execution of the lease, and nothing turns upon it. When however the second payment was made, the sum paid was Rs. 6,714 and odd, and the payment was made in respect of rent up to the 31st March, 1930. After this, all the subsequent payments were made up to the 31st March of the succeeding year, evidently because the financial year, which the parties considered themselves to be governed by, ran from the 1st April to the 31st March of the succeeding year. It was presumably in view of this fact that the plaintiff filed an application on the 6th November, 1941, for amending the plaint so as to include the following statement - The plaintiff submits that even assuming that the registered lease terminated on the 23rd February, 1938, by an agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant No. 1, the latter was allowed to hold over up to the 31st March, 1938.  This application however was rejected, because it was made at a very late stage, that is to say, after the defendants evidence had been closed and an adjournment had been granted to the plaintiff to adduce rebutting evidence. However that may be, the utmost that can be said upon the evidence as it stands is that by the implied consent of the parties the period of the lease was extended up to the 31st March, 1938. In this view, the respondent No. 1 became entitled to re-enter after the 31st March, and no notice under section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act was necessary. In the circumstances, the decree for ejectment passed by the courts below must be upheld. The next question which arises in the case turns on the proper construction of clause 11 of Part I and clause 1 of Part III of the lease, which have already been quoted. It seems to us that clause 11 should be read as a whole, and, when it is so read, it becomes clear that it was intended to be applicable only where the Secretary of State decided to exercise his right to terminate the lease at any time subject to 6 months notice, in the event of the lessee failing to observe and duly perform the conditions mentioned in the lease. In such a case, if the lessee did not remove the boilers, engines and all other materials and yield up the premises to the Secretary of State, those articles were to become the property of the Secretary of State. This clause is evidently not applicable to the present case. The clause which applies to this case is clause 1 of Part III, which is intended to be applicable to the normal case of the lease expiring by efflux of time. This clause, as we have seen, provides that the lessee shall be at liberty to keep on the demised premises for 3 months after the expiration of the lease any bricks, boilers, etc., but it also provides that any bricks and other materials left in contravention of this condition shall become the absolute property of the Secretary of State without payment. There can be no doubt that under this clause, the bricks and other materials have become the absolute property of the plaintiff.  The only question is as to the meaning of other materials. It seems to us on an examination of the lease as a whole that there must be a distinction between materials, and machinery and tools and similar articles, and the words other materials have no reference to engines, trucks, railway and tramway lines and plant. They mean building materials such as bricks, tiles and similar articles that might have been manufactured by the appellants on the demised premises. That being so, the decree under appeal should be modified accordingly. The only other point which arises for consideration relates to the plaintiffs prayer for a decree for permanent injunction against the defendants, to restrain them from removing or otherwise disposing of the articles in regard to which the decree is to be passed. It was contended on behalf of the appellants that the respondent No. 1 not being in possession of these properties could not ask for the relief of injunction without asking for the declaration of its title in respect of them and possession over them, and in support of this proposition, the following cases were cited - Ratnasabhapathi Pillai and Others v. Ramaswami Aiyar I.L.R. 33 Mad. 482, Bhramar Lal Banduri and Others v. Nanda Lal Chowdhuri 24 I.C. 199 and Valia Tamburatti v. Parvati and Others I.L.R. 13 Mad. 455. After reading and fully considering those cases, we find them to be wholly inapplicable to the present case. In the present case, it has been found that the bricks and other materials have become the property of the plaintiff, and there can be no legal objection to the granting of an injunction as prayed. DECISION ??"
102.0,Land Dispute,"CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION Civil Appeal No. 90 of 1950. Appeal against the Judgment and Decree dated the 22nd July 1948 of the High Court of Judicature at Calcutta (K. C. Mitter, and K.C. Chunder J J) in appeal from Original Decree No. 49 of 1942 arising out of Decree dated the 8th September 1941 of the Subordi- nate Judge at Asansole in Suit No. 1 of 1941. Purusottam Chatterji (S. N. Mukherjee, with him) for the appellants. Panchanan Ghose, (P. C. Chatterjee, with him) for the respondent. 1951. May 4. the following judgments were delivered -- DAS J.--This appeal arises out of a suit filed by the appellants on January 2, 1941, in the Court of the Subordi- nate Judge, Asansole. That suit came to be filed in circum- stances which may now be stated shortly. A suit had been instituted by one Kumar Dakhineswar Malia against Rameswar Malia, Rani Bhaba Sundari and others for partition of the Searsole Raj Estate. One Bhagabati Charan Mitra was appointed receiver of that estate in that suit. On August 10, 1908, the said receiver with the permis- sion of the Court which had appointed him as receiver grant- ed two mining leases, each for 999 years--one in respect of 5/16 share of the Malias in Mouza Monohar Bahal and the other in respect of 230 bighas in village Marich Kota--to a firm then carrying on business under the name and style of Laik Banerjee Company. On the same day the said receiver with like permission mortgaged these properties to the said firm as security for the due repayment of the loan of Rs. 100,000 advanced by that firm. The Malias joined the re- ceiver in executing the aforesaid leases and the mortgage. As a result of these transactions the firm of Laik Banerjee Company became the lessees for 999 years of the two properties as well as the mortgagee of the lessors interest in the same. By diverse processes not necessary to be detailed, the appellants have become the successors in interest of the mortgagors and the respondent Deva Prasanna Mukerjee has become the successor in interest of the mortga- gee under the mortgage of August 10, 1908. On March 31, 1922, Deva Prasanna filed suit No. 78 of 1922 for enforcing the mortgage of 1908. Preliminary decree was passed in the last mentioned suit on July 31, 1928, and a final decree for sale was made I on February 26, 1929. In execution of this final decree the mortgaged properties were sold at a Court i sale and were purchased by Deva Prasanna for Rs. 59,000. This sale was confirmed by the Court on June 30, 1931. A large sum remaining still due to Deva Prasanna, he applied for, and on October 30, 1935, obtained a personal decree for Rs. 1,27,179-0-6 against Raja Pramatha Nath Malia who had by inheritance acquired the lessors interest and become the borrower. In 1936, Deva Prasanna started execution case No. 118 of 1936 for execution of the personal decree and attached certain properties alleging that the same belonged to the Raja. The exact date of the attachment does not appear from the printed record. The Raja as Sibait of a certain deity and his two sons, the appellants before us, objected to the attachment of these properties and filed a claim case. Negotiations for settlement started and eventually, on January 30, 1937, a petition (Ex. 2) was filed in the exe- cuting Court stating as follows - The judgment debtor having made special requests to the decree-holder for an amicable settlement of the aforesaid execution case, the decree-holder has agreed to the same. But some time is required to settle the talks and all the terms etc. The judgment debtor has paid to the decree holder the costs of this execution amounting to Rs. 76-14-0, and he having made requests for this execution case being struck off for the present on keeping the attachment in force, the decreeholder has agreed to it. It is, therefore, prayed that under the circumstances aforesaid, the Court may be pleased to strike off this execution case keeping the attachment in force. Neither the original nor a certified copy of the order made on that date by the executing Court on the above petition is forthcoming but the parties have definite- ly agreed that the order is substantially and correctly entered in column 20 of Ex. F which is a certified copy of extract from the Register of applications for executions of decrees relating to execution Case No. 118 of 1936. The heading of column 20 is Date on which execution case was finally disposed of and purport of final order. The entry in column 20 under that head is  H. admits receipt of Rs. 76-14/- as costs of this case from the J.D. The execution case is dismissed for non- prosecution--the attachment already effected in this case continuing. 30th January 1937. The entry under column 11 of that very exhibit reads as follows -- Claim case automatically drops as the execution case is dismissed. It is, therefore, rejected without any sort of adjudication. 30th January 1937. In May 1937, the Searsole Raj Estate came under the charge of the Court of Wards. By a Kobala executed with the permission of the Board of Revenue Raja Pramatha Nath Malia and his two sons Kumars Pashupati Nath Malia and Kshitipati Nath Malia represented by Kumar Kshitipati Nath Malia as the Manager of the Searsole Raj Wards Estate conveyed a property known as Senapati Mahal to Deva Prasanna in full settlement of his claim under the personal decree against the Raja. By an agreement of even date, Deva Prasanna agreed to reconvey Senapati Mahal to the Kumars if he was paid Rs. 90,000/- within two years from that date. Senapati Mahal orginally belonged to the Raja but had been tranSferred by him to his two sons. A creditor, however, had filed a suit under sec- tion 53 of the Transfer of Property Act challenging that transfer and had actually got a decree declaring that trans- fer as fradulent and void as against the creditors of the Raja An appeal was filed by the Kumars which was pending at the date of the Kobala of January 4, 1939, and, in the circum- stances, it was considered safer to join the Raja in the last mentioned Kobala in favour of Deva Prasanna. On June 2, 1939, a petition was filed in the Court of the Subordinate Judge, Asansole, on behalf of Deva Prasanna as the decree holder. It was headed Money Execution Case No. 118 of 1936. The relevant portions of this petition were as follows-- That the above execution case was disposed of on the 30th January 1937 with the attachment of the properties subsisting since then the decree put into execution in the above case has been adjusted after remission of a large amount of interest by the out and out sale of certain properties by a registered Kobala dated 4th January 1939 So there is no longer any need of the said attachment remaining subsisting. It is, therefore, prayed that the attachment may be withdrawn.  On the same day the following order was made on that petition-- Heard learned pleaders for the parties. They jointly ask me to cancel the attachment (existing by special order) in Money Ex. 118 of 1936 though that case was dismissed. Order The said attachment is cancelled and the decree in question is recorded as adjusted as stated by learned plead- er for the decree-holder and pleader of the judgment-debtor according to the adjustment mentioned but not detailed in this petition of to-day. Make necessary notes and send this petition to the District Record Room. In the remarks column No. 22 in Ex. F the following entry was made -- The said attachment is cancelled and the decree in question is recorded as adjusted as stated by learned pleader for the D.H. and the pleader of the Judgment Debtor according to the adjustment mentioned but not detailed in this petition of to-day. Dated 2nd June 1989. The Raja died in August, 1940, leaving the two appellants as his sons and legal representatives. The Bengal Money Lend- ers Act, 1940 (Bengal Act X of 1940) hereinafter called the Act, came into force on September 1, 1940. On January 2, 1941, the appellants who, as the legal representatives of the Raja, became borrowers within the meaning of the Act filed the suit out of which the present appeal has arisen. The suit was filed by the appellants against the respondent under section 36 of the Act praying for reopening the trans- actions and taking accounts and for release from all liabil- ities in excess of the limits specified by law. In short, they asked the Court to give them relief by exercising the powers given to the Court by section 36 of the Act. There was also a prayer for reconveyance of the Senapati Mahal. The respondent filed his written statement setting up a variety of defences rounded on merits as well as on legal pleas in bar. On May 8, 1941, the Subordinate Judge settled the issues and fixed June 9, 1941, for a preliminary hear- ing of the suit and particularly of such of the issues as have been based on the pleas in bar. Eventually, the case was taken up for preliminary hearing on September 4, 1941, and by his judgment delivered on September 8, 1941, the learned Subordinate Judge dismissed the suit on issue No. 2 which was as follows Does the plaint disclose a valid cause of action for the suit ? The appellants preferred an appeal to the High Court at Calcutta. Although the High Court (R.C. Mitter and K.C. Chunder JJ.) did not accept all the reasonings on which the learned Subordinate Judge had based his decision, they, however, agreed that the appellants could get no relief as the decrees in suit No. 78 of 1922 could not be reopened, as they were not passed in a suit to which this Act applies and consequently dis- missed the appeal.  The appellants have now come up on appeal before us after having obtained a certificate from the High Court under section 110 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Learned Advocate appearing in support of this appeal before us has contended that the High Court was in error in holding that the decrees in Suit No. 78 of 1922 were not liable to be reopened under the second proviso to section 36 (1). Learned advocate for the respondent while joining issue on this point also raised a point which, however, did not find favour with the High Court, namely, that the respondent as a bona fide assignee for value of the mortgage debt was protected by sub-section (5) of section 36. It is quite clear that if either of the two points is decided against the appellants, this appeal must fail. The main provisions of section 36 (1)are in the follow- ing terms -- Notwithstanding anything contained in any law for the time being in force, if in any suit to which this Act ap- plies, or in any suit brought by a borrower for relief under this section, whether heard ex parte or otherwise, the Court has reason to believe that the exercise of one or more of the powers under this section will give relief to the bor- rower, it shall exercise all or any of the following powers as it may consider appropriate namely, shall (a) reopen any transaction and take an account between the parties (b) notwithstanding any agreement, purporting to close previous dealings and to create new obligations, reopen any account already taken between the parties (c) release the borrower of all liability in excess of the limits specified in clauses (t) and (2) of section 30 (d) if anything has been paid or allowed in account on or after the first day of January, 1939, in respect of the liability referred to in clause (c), order the lender to repay any sum which the Court considers to be repayable in respect of such payment or allowance in account as aforesaid (e) set aside either wholly or in part or revise or alter any security given or agreement made in respect of any loan, and if the lender has parted with the security, order him to indemnify the borrower in such manner and to such extent as it may deem just. It will be noticed (a) that the provisions of this section apply notwithstanding anything contained in any law for the time being in force, (b) that the powers conferred on the Court or to be exercised either in any suit to which this Act applies or in any suit brought by a borrower for relief under the section and (c) that the Court is called upon to exercise all or any of the powers conferred on it by the section if the Court has reason to believe that the exercise of one or more of the powers will give relief to the borrower. In the present case the borrowers have insti- tuted a substantive suit for relief under section 36 and, therefore, if there was nothing also in the section and the Court had the requisite belief, the Court could exercise all or any of the powers and give relief to the borrowers in terms of the prayers of the plaint. There are, however, two provisions to sub-section (1) of section 36. The relevant portion of the second proviso is expressed in the words following Provided that in exercise of these powers the Court shall not- (i)  do anything which affects any decree of a Court, other than a decree in a suit to which the Act applies which was not fully satisfied by the first day of January, 1939, or The proviso makes it quite clear that in exercise of the powers the Court cannot reopen or otherwise affect a decree of a Court unless such decree is one which was passed in a suit to which this Act applies and which was not fully satisfied by January 1, 1939. In the light of the decision of the Full Bench of the Calcutta High Court in Mrityunjay Mitra v. Satis Chandra Banerji(1) which was approved by the Privy Council in Jadu Nath Roy v. Kshitish Chandra Acharyya(2), it has not been contended, in view of the fact that the personal decree for the balance remained unsatisfied on January 1, 1939, that the decrees in Suit No. 78 of 1922 were fully satisfied within the meaning of the above proviso. Therefore, the only thing that remains to be ascertained is whether the decrees were passed in a suit to which this Act applies. Section 2 (22) of the Act is as follows  In this Act, unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context-  Suit to which this Act applies means any suit or proceeding instituted or filed on or after the 1st day of January, 1939, or pending on that date and includes a pro- ceeding in execution-- (a) for the recovery of a loan advanced before or after the commencement of this Act (b) for the enforcement of any agreement entered into before or after the commencement of this Act, whether by way of settlement of account or otherwise, or of any security so taken, in respect of any loan advanced whether before or after the commencement of this Act or (c) for the redemption of any security given before or after the commencement of this Act in respect of any loan advanced whether before or after the commencement of this Act. The words instituted or filed on or after the 1st day of January, 1939, or pending on that date have been read and understood as qualifying the words any suit or proceed- ing in the beginning of the definition as well as the words proceeding in execution occurring further down see per Spens C.J. in Bank of Commerce Ltd. v. Amulya Krishna (3). Accordingly, it has  I.L.R. 11944) 2Cal. 376 48 C.W.N. 361. L.R. 76 I.A. 179 at p. 190. (3) 1944 F.C.R. 126A.I.R. 1944 F.C. 18. been held in Ram Kumar De v. Abhoya Pada Bhattacharjee (1) that where a decree is such that the suit in which it was passed had terminated before January 1, 1939, and no pro- ceeding in execution was started or was actually pending on or after that date it is not a decree in a suit to which this Act appliesand cannot be reopened. The same view was upheld by a Special Bench of the Calcutta High Court in Aparna Kumari v. Girish Chandra (2)which overruled two earlier decisions to the contrary. The construction put upon section 2 (22)by the Special Bench and the reasons given by them appear to us to be well-founded. In the case now before us, the Suit No. 78 of 1922 was instituted and all the three decrees were passed long before the specified date. The only question that has therefore, to be consid- ered is whether any proceeding in execution was pending on or after that date. The answer to this question will depend on the true meaning and effect of the orders made by the executing Court (i) on January 30, 1937, and (ii) on June 2, 1939. As to (i)--It is not disputed that the order of January 30, 1937, was made under Order XXI, rule57, as amended by the Calcutta High Court.  Order XXI, rule 57, is expressed in the following terms - Where any property has been attached in execution of a decree but by reason of the decree-holders default the Court is unable to proceed further with the application for execution, it shall either dismiss the application or for any sufficient reason adjourn the proceedings to a future date. Upon the dismissal of such application the attachment shall cease. The marginal note of the rule is determination of at- tachment. The reason why rule 57 was introduced in the Code of 1908 has been explained by Rank in C.J. in Shibnath Singh Ray v. Sheikh Saberuddin Ahmad(3) as follows-- (1) 46 C.W.N. 557 A.I.R. 1942 Cal. 441. (2) 48 C.W.N, 406. I.L.R. 56 Cal. 416 at pp. 421-422 Rule 57 of Order XXI was a new provision introduced in 1908. It is evident from the language of the rule itself, and it is still more evident from the circumstances under which it was passed, that it was intended to provide a remedy for the grievance or inconvenience which is apt to arise, where, after an attachment in execution, the applica- tion for execution cannot further be proceeded with by reason of the decree-holders default. This was, and still is, a very common case. The decree-holder makes some informal arrangement to give the judgment-debtor time with- out obtaining full satisfaction of the decree the applica- tion for execution is not further prosecuted it is not withdrawn neither party attends. In these circumstances, the object of the rule is to say that the Court must make either an order for adjournment or an order of dismissal. The reason why it was necessary to require the Court, if it did not adjourn a proceeding to a definite date, to dismiss the application for execution formally and definitely can be amply illustrated from the decided cases. In the absence of a definite order of dismissal the files of the Courts became encumbered with a number of applications for execution which were water-logged and derelict, and a practice arose whereby such applications were ordered to be struck off.  This was a practice not justified by the Code and in cases where attachments in execution had already been entered, the question arose whether the effect of an order striking off was that the attachment made upon application for execution was itself struck off or whether it remained notwithstanding such an order. Many other awkward and important questions arose out of this practice and the object of rule 57 was to ensure that this illogical and inconvenient practice should be stopped. Applications for execution were to be definitely dismissed if they were not adjourned to a future date. The object of the last sentence in rule 57 is to settle the question whether, when the application in execution is dismissed any attachment made under that application should fall to the ground or should subsist, and the legislature has provided that it is to fall to the ground. The new rule thus introduced left two distinct courses open to the executing Court in the situation envisaged by the rule. Each course had its advantage as well as its disadvantage. Thus the adjournment of the execution pro- ceedings kept the attachment alive without any special direction. While the adoption of this course helped bona fide arrangement between the decree-holder and the judgment-debtor as to the time and manner of satisfaction of the decree it was calculated also to encourage desultory proceedings resulting in undesirable congestion in the files of the Executing Court by keeping alive so many execution proceedings.  On the other hand, while the dismissal of an application in the circumstances mentioned in the rule had the merit of preventing a congestion of the file by finally disposing of the application by a final order, it was calcu- lated to discourage decreeholders from giving even reasona- ble accommodation to the judgment-debtor on account of the destruction of the attachment which left the judgment-debtor free to deal with the property to the detriment of the decreeholder after the attachment ceased. It was evidently with a view to preserve the advantage of a dismissal and at the same time to avoid the disadvantage of the rigid rule of cesser of the attachment that the Calcutta High Court amend- ed rule 57 by adding the words unless the Court shall make an order to the contrary at the end of the last sentence of that rule. The rule thus amended leaves three courses open to the Executing Court in case it finds it difficult to proceed with the execution case by reason of the default of the decree-holder. It may (1) adjourn the proceedings for good reason which will automatically keep the attachment alive or (2) simply dismiss the application which will automatically destroy the attachment or (3) dismiss the application but specifically keep alive the attachment by an express order. The rule, as amended, therefore, contemplates three distinct forms of order, any one of which may be made by the Court in the circumstances mentioned in the rule. The question before us is as to the category in which the order made on January 30, 1937, in Execution Case No. 118 of 1936 falls. It will be recalled that the order of January 30, 1937, was made on a petition (Exhibit 2) filed on that day in Execution Case No. 118 of 1936. Great stress was laid by the learned advocate for the appellants on the words struck off for the present occurring in the body of that petition. It will be noticed that those words formed part of the request of the judgmentdebtor which was being recited in the petition. In the actual prayer portion the decree-holder did not use the words for the present but only asked the Court to strike off the execution case keeping the attachment in force. Further, apart from what the parties wanted, the Court made its intention clear in the very order that it passed and which is entered in column 20 of Exhibit F. The Court regarded the willingness of the the decree-holder to enter into a long and protracted negotiation with the judg- ment-debtor as evidence of unwillingness on the part of the decree-holder to diligently prosecute the execution proceedings and accordingly dismissed the execution case for non-prosecution but thought fit to expressly keep alive the attachment. It is quite obvious that the Court made an order of the third kind mentioned above. The three forms of order permissible under rule 57 as amended by the High Court are quite distinct and independent of each other and there is no room for their overlapping. If the mere continuation of attachment will automatically convert an express order of dismissal of the execution application which is a final order into an order of adjournment which is not a final order then there was no point in the High Court taking the trouble of amending rule 57 at all. The Court could by simply adjourning the proceedings automatically continue the attachment without any express direction in that behalf. The fact that the Court gave an express direction that the attachment should continue clearly indicates that the Court intended to make a final order of dismissal. Again, the heading of column 20 in Exhibit F clearly indicates that only a final order is to be entered in that column. The fact that the order was entered in that column affords some justification for the conclusion that the Court made a final order of dismissal. That the claim case was automatically dropped is yet another indication that the execution case was at an end. The fact that the judgment-debtor had paid the full costs of the execution case is also a feature which goes to show, to a certain extent at any rate if not deci- sively, that the execution proceeding was finally disposed of by the order. The following endorsement appears on the petition Ex. 2 (a), dated June 2, 1939 Heard learned pleaders for the parties. They jointly ask me to cancel the attachment (existing by special order) in Money Ex. 118 of 1936 though that case was dismissed.  This endorsement also clearly shows that the Court itself understood that the order that it made on January 30 1937, was a final order of dismissal and that the attachment had been continued by a special order. On a consideration of all these matters I have not the least doubt in my mind that the order of January 30, 1937, was in form and in substance a final order of dismissal of the Execution Case No. 118 of 1936 and that the attachment was continued by a special order such as is contemplated and authorised by the amend- ment made by the Calcutta High Court in rule 57. Learned advocate for the appellants contended that if the execution case came to an end the attachment could not be left hanging in the air. There is no substance in this argument. Ordi- narily, an attachment is supported by an execution case and if the execution case is simply dismissed the attachment must fail with it. But rule 57, as amended, expressly empow- ers the Court to dismiss an execution application but at the same time to keep alive the attachment by a special order. That is what was done in this case. Here the attachment does not, to use the expression of the learned advocate for the appellants, hang in the air. It rests upon the solid foundation of a special order which rule 57, as amended, in terms authorises the Court to make. The continuance of the attachment, in the circumstances, needs no execution proceeding to support it. Take the case of an attachment before judgment. Under Order XXXVIII, rule 11, where after an order of attachment before judgment a decree is passed in favour of the plaintiff, it is not necessary upon an application for execution of such a decree to apply for re-attachment of the property. It means that the attachment continues and the judgmentdebtor cannot deal with the property to the disadvantage of the decree- holder. After the decree is passed, the attachment continues but nobody will say that although there has been no applica- tion for the execution of the decree at any time by the decree-holder there is, nevertheless, an execution proceed- ing pending merely because the attachment continues. Here also the attachment subsists and rests only upon the terms of Order, XXXVIII rule 11, and without any proceeding. Such attachment cannot be called a proceeding in execution, for none was ever initiated after the decree was passed. In my judgment, the order of January 30, 1937, was a final order which brought the Execution Case No. 118 of 1936, to an and and the attachment continued, not because there was a pend- ing execution proceeding but because a special order was made under Order XXI, rule 57, as amended by the High Court. As to (ii)--Learned advocate for the appellants then contended that the petition (Ex. 2a) dated June 2, 1939, amounted to a proceeding in execution and as that was insti- tuted and was pending after January 1, 1939 the proceedings came within the definition in section 2 (22)of a suit to which this Act applies. I do not think this argument is sound. The petition (Ex.2a) was not really an application at all. See Raja Shri Prakash Singh v.  The Allahabad Bank Ltd. (1). In substance, it was nothing but a certification by the decree-holder of the satisfaction of the decree. The mere fact (1) 33 C.W.N. 267 A.I.R. 1929 P.C. 19, that the document was in the form of a petition could not convert what was really the usual certifying procedure into a proceeding in execution for recovery of a loan or for enforcement of any agreement. It was purely an intimation given to the Court by the decreeholder that the decree had been satisfied out of Court and the prayer for withdrawal of the attachment was merely consequential and would follow as a matter of course on full satisfaction of the decree being recorded. The order made on that petition also shows that the decree was recorded as adjusted and the attachment was cancelled. In my judgment, that petition (Ex. 2a) was not an application such as would initiate a proceeding in execution for any of the purposes mentioned in clauses (a) or (b) or (c) of section 2 (22) of the Act. For reasons stated above, the decrees sought to be reopened were not decrees made in a suit to which this Act applies. Suit No. 78 of 1922 was neither instituted on or after January 1, 1939, nor was it pending on that date, all the three decrees having been passed long before that date. Nor was any proceeding in execution such as is contemplated by section 2 (22) instituted or pending on or after that date. The Execution Case No. 118 of 1936 was at an end on January 30, 1937, and the petition of June 2, 1939, was not an application at all and was certainly not a proceeding in execution within the meaning of section 2 (22) of the Act. This conclusion is sufficient to dismiss this appeal and it is not necessary for us to consider the other question raised by the respondent on the strength of section 36 (5) of the Act and I express no opinion on that question. The result is that this appeal must stand dismissed with costs and I order accordingly. KANIA C.J.--I agree. PATANJALI SASTRI J.--The facts bearing on the dispute in this appeal are fully stated in the judgment of ray brother Das which I have had the advantage of reading and it is unnecessary to recapitulate them here. The appellant mortgagor seeks in these proceedings the reliefs provided by the Bengal Money-lenders Act, 1940 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) in respect of a decree debt payable by him. The respondent who represents the sub-mortgagee decree-holder invokes the protection of two exemptions contained in the Act (1) Section 86 (1), proviso (ii), which exempts inter alia any decree other than a decree in a suit to which this Act applies which was not fully satisfied by the first day of January, 1939.  This raises a dispute as to whether the respondents decree was passed in a suit to which the Act applies. (2) Section 36 (5) which exempts the rights of any assignee or holder for value if the Court is satisfied that the assignment to him was bona fide and that he had not received the notice re- ferred to in clause (a) of sub-section (1) of section 28. This raises the question whether a sub-mortgagee is an assignee within the meaning of the Act. On the first question a suit to which this Act applies is defined in section 2 (22) as meaning any suit or pro- ceeding instituted or filed on or after the 1st day of Janu- ary, 1939, or pending on that date and includes a proceeding in execution for (among other things) the recovery of a loan advanced before or after the commencement of this Act. This definition has been construed as requiring that the pro- ceeding in execution referred to therein should be pending on 1st January, 1939, and the question accordingly arises whether the order of the executing court dated 30th January, 1937, which purported to dismiss the respondents execution case for non-prosecution while continuing the attachment already effected, terminated the proceeding in execution which had resulted in the attachment. It was said that the order was made in accordance with Order XXI, rule 57, of the Civil Procedure Code as amended by the Calcutta High Court and must, therefore, be taken to have been intended to put an end to the execution proceeding altogether. I am not satisfied that such was the result of the dismissal. The amendment which added the words unless the court shall make an order to the contrary at the end of the rule envisages a dismissal of an applica- tion for execution while at the same time continuing a subsisting attachment. The dismissal of 30th January, 1987, must, therefore, be taken to be a dismissal of the execution application then before the court and cannot be taken to have any wider operation. On the other hand, the continu- ance, in express terms, of the attachment notwithstanding the dismissal, indicates that the proceeding which had resulted in the attachment was kept alive to be carried forward later on by sale of the attached property. Attachment itself is a proceeding in execution and, so long.as it subsists, the proceeding in execution can well be regarded as pending. In In re Clagetts Estate Fordham v.

This is a petition under article 32 of the Constitution of India by Shri Visheswar Rao, zamindar and proprietor of Ahiri zamindari, an estate as defined in section 2 (3) of the Central Provinces Land Revenue Act, II of 1917, and situated in tehsil Sironcha, district Chanda (Madhya Pradesh), for the enforcement of his fundamental right to property under article 31(1) of the Constitution by the issue of an appropriate writ or a direction to the respondent State restraining it from disturbing his possession of the estate, and eighty malguzari villages situate in the Garchiroli tehsil of the same district. The petitioner and his ancestors have been owing and enjoying these properties in full proprietary right for several generations past. On the 5th April, 1950, the Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly enacted an Act called the Madhya Pradesh Abolition of Proprietary Right Act. The Act received the assent of the President of India on the 22nd January, 1951, and was published in the Madhya Pradesh Gazette on the 26th January, 1951, as Act I of 1951. By a notification in a gazette extraordinary issued on the 27th January, 1951, the Madhya Pradesh Government fixed 31st March 1951, as the date of vesting of the estates under section 3 of the Act. The petitioner thus was to lose his estate and lands on the 31st March 1951. On the 9th March, 1951, i.e. before the vesting date, he presented the present application to this court for the issue of appropriate writs against the government prohibiting it from taking possession of his properties. It was alleged that the Madhya Pradesh Act, I of 1951 was unconstitutional and void and infringed the fundamental rights of the petitioner in a variety of ways. For a proper appreciation of the ground on which the validity of the Act is being challenged it is necessary to set out the relevant provisions of the Act and to state the facts which led to this enactment. Madhya Pradesh is a composite State, comprising the Central Provisions, Berar and the merged territories. By an agreement of merger made between the rules of States and the Dominion of in India dated the 15th December 1947, certain territories which at one time were under the Indian States Agency and were held by these rulers were integrated with the Dominion. The intergration actually took place on the 1st January, 1948. On the 1st August, 1949, the States were merged in the Madhya Pradesh. There were in all 106 estates in Madhya Pradesh as defined in section 2 (3) of Act I of 1951 and held by zamindars. Most of the lands are owned by malguzars of mahals in the status of Malkan cabza. The land system prevailing in Madhya Pradesh is malguzari (except in certain areas where the ryotwari system is in vogue), the malguzar being an intermediary between the State and the tiller. Land is also held on a variety of subordinate tenures by absolute occupancy tenants, occupancy tenants, ryots, thikedars, mafidars ilaqadars etc. Land revenue in Madhya Pradesh was last assessed under the Central Provinces Land Revenue Act, II of 1917. The estate holders pay land revenue on the lands comprised in the estates at a concession rate. The payment is technically called tekoli In 1939 there was an ad hoc increase in the amount of tekoli by the Central Provinces Revision of Land Revenue Estates Act, I of 1939. On the 3rd September 1946 the Central Provinces and Bear Legislative Assembly passed a resolution for the elimination of intermediaries between the State and the peasant. Soon after passing of this resolution several laws were enacted, it is said with a view to achieve this result, the impugned Act being the last of the series. In 1947, the Central Provinces Land Revenue Estates Act, XXV of 1947, was enacted. The revenue assessment, viz., tekoli, on the estates was, we are told enhanced, in some places from thirty to fifty per cent, of the full jama and in others from forty to sixty per cent. In the same year was enacted the Central Provinces Land Revenue Revision Mahals Act, XXVI of 1947. The land assessment on malguzari villages was it is alleged, raised to 75 per cent. from 45 to 50 per cent. of malguzari assets. This was done without recourse to a settlement. In 1948 came the Central Provinces and Berar Revocation of Exemptions Act, XXXVII of 1948, making persons exempted from payment of land revenue liable for it. This legislation, it is urged, resulted in the reduction of the net income of the proprietors to a large extent. On the 11th October, 1949, the impugned Act was introduced in the Madhya Pradesh Assembly. It was referred to a Select Committee on the 15th October, 1949 the Select Committee reported on the 9th March, 1950, the report was published on the 17th March, 1950, and was taken into consideration on the 29th March, 1950, by the Assembly. On the 30th March, 1950, the opposition moved for the circulation of the Bill. The circulation motion was negatived on the 3rd April 1950, and the Bill was discussed clause by clause were passed between the 3rd of April of the 5th of April. On the 5th April. On the 5th April, 1950, the member in charge of the Bill moved as follows -  Speaker Sir, I now move that the Central Provinces Berar Abolition of Proprietary Rights (Estates, Mahals Alienated Lands) Bill, 1949 (No. 64 of 1949) as considered by the House be passed into law. The Honble the Speaker said Motion moved that the Central Provisions Berar Abolition of Proprietary Rights (Estates, Mahals, Alienated Lands) Bill 1949 (No. 64 of 1949) as considered by the House be passed into law,  A number of speeches were made at the third reading stage. The opposition was in a hopeless minority. The trend of the speeches was of a laudatory character, each member hailing the Bill as a peace of great reform in the Madhya Pradesh land system. No motion of a dilatory nature was tabled and as a matter of fact there was no opposition whatsoever to the passing of the Bill. Some members expressed the opinion that the provisions of the Act did not go far enough, others thought that the provisions as to compensation should have been more liberal, but there was none who was for rejecting the Bill as it stood. The report of the proceedings of the 5th April, 1950, does not contain the note that the motion that the Bill be passed into law was carried. The omission of this note in the proceedings of the proceedings of the legislature has furnished a basis for the argument that the Bill was never passed into law. The proceedings were printed on the 21st June, 1950, and were signed by the Speaker on the 1st October 1950. The original Bill that was submitted to the President for his assent was printed on the 29th April, 1950, and it bears on it the certificate of the Speaker dated the 10th May, 1950, stating that the Bill was duly passed by the legislature on the 5th April, 1950. This certificate was signed by the Speaker a considerable time ahead of his signing the proceedings. The Act, as already stated, received the assent of the President on the 22nd January, 1951, and was published in the Madhya Pradesh Gazette on the 26th January, 1951, as Madhya Pradesh Act I of 1951. Against the constitutionality of this Act a number of petitioners were made in the High Court of Nagpur but they were all dismissed by that court on the 9th April, while this petition along with some others was pending in this Court.  The preamble of the Act is in these terms - An Act to provide for the acquisition of the rights of proprietors in estates, mahals, alienated villages and alienated lands in Madhya Pradesh and to make provision for other matters connected there with. The legislation clearly falls within entry 36 of List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution. The Madhya Pradesh Legislature had therefore undoubted competence to enact it. The Act is divided into eleven chapters and three schedules. Chapter II deals with the vesting of proprietary rights in the State and states the consequences of the vesting. Section 3 is in these terms - Save as other wise provided in this Act, on and from a date to be specified by a notification by the State Government in this behalf all proprietary rights in an estate, mahal alienated village or alienated land, as the case may be, in the area specified in the notification vesting in a proprietor of such estate, mahal, alienated village, alienated land, or in a person having interest in such proprietary right through the proprietor, shall pass from such proprietor or such other person to and vest in the State for the purposes of the State free of all encumbrances  Section 4 provides that after the publication of the notification under Section 3, all rights titles and interest vesting in the proprietor or any person having interest in such proprietary right through the proprietor in such area including land (cultivable or barren), grass land, scrub jungle, forest trees fishes, wells, tanks ponds water-channels, ferries, pathways, villages sites, hats bazars and meals and in all subsoil including rights if any in mines and minerals, whether being worked or not, shall cease and be vested in the State for purposes of the State free of all encumbrances but that the proprietor shall continue to retain the possession of his homestead, home-farm land, and in the Central Provisions, also of land brought under cultivation by him after the agricultural year 1948-49 but before the date of vesting.  The proprietor is entitled to recover any sums which became due to him before the date of vesting by virtue of his proprietor rights. All open enclosures used for agricultural or domestic purposes, all buildings, places of worship wells situated in and trees standings on lands included in such enclosures or house sites etc. continue to remain in possession of proprietor and are to be settled with him by the State Government on such terms and conditions as it may determine. Similarly, certain private wells, trees tanks and groves continue to remain in possession of proprietor or other person who may be interested in them. Chapter III deals with the assessment of compensation. It is provided in section 8 that the State Government shall pay compensation to the proprietor in accordance with the rules contained in Schedule I. Besides the amount so determined, Government has to pay compensation for any amount spent on the construction of a tank or well used for agricultural purposes, where such tank or well vests in the State Government. In addition to all these amounts, the State Government has pay compensation for lands within the area of a municipality or cantonment in accordance with the rules contained in Schedule II. The Compensation for divestment of proprietary rights becomes due from the date vesting and it is enacted that it shall carry interest at the rate of two and a half per cent. per annum from the date of vestings to the date of payment. Section 9 provides as follows -  The compensation payable under section 8, may, in accordance with the rules made in this behalf, be paid in one or more of the following modes, namely -  in cash in full or in annual instalments not exceeding thirty  in bonds either negotiable or not negotiable carrying interest at the rate specified in sub-section (4) of section 8 and of guaranteed face value maturing within a specified period not exceeding thirty years. The other sections in this chapter deal with interim payment and appointment of compensation officers and lay down the procedure for the determination of compensation. Schedule I provides that the amount of compensation in the Central Provinces and in Berar shall be ten times the net income determined in accordance with the rules mentioned in the schedule. In merged territories the compensation is payable on a sliding scale varying from two times to ten times the net income. Schedule II lays down the measure of compensation on a scale varying from five to fifteen times the assessment on the land as specified in the schedule. Section 2 of the Schedule I provides for the calculation of the gross income by adding the amount of income received by a proprietor from the aggregate of the rents from the tenants as recorded in the jamabandi for the previous agricultural year the siwai income that is income from various sources such as jalkar, bankar, phalkar, hats, bazars, melas grazing and village forest calculated at two times the income recorded in the current settlement of 1923 and the consent money on transfer of tenancy lands-the average of transactions recorded in the village papers for ten years preceding the agricultural year in which the date of vesting falls. The schedule also provides the method of determination of the gross income of a mahal as well as of an alienated village or alienated land separately. It also provides for the determination of this income in the case of mines and forests. The method suggested for assessing the net income is that out of the gross income the following items have to be deducted, i.e. assessed land revenue, sums payable during the previous agricultural year on account of cesses and local rates, the average of income-tax paid in respect of income received from big forests during the period of thirty agricultural years preceding the agricultural year in which the relevant date falls and cost of management varying from 8 to 15 per cent. of the gross annual income on incomes varying from Rs. 2,000 to Rs. 15,000. It is further provided that not withstanding anything contained in sub-rule (2) the net incomes shall in case be reduced to less than five per cent. of the gross income. Chapter IV deals with certain incidental matters in respect of the determination of the debts of proprietors. Its provisions are analgulus to the provisions of Debt Conciliation or Relief of Indebtedness Act.  It is provided in Chapter V how the actual amount of compensation is to be determined and paid. Chapter VI deals with that part of Madhya Pradesh which is defined as Central Provinces in the Act. It is provided herein that a proprietor who has been divested of his estate will have malik-makbuza rights in his homenfarm lands. Absolute occupancy tenants and occupancy tenants can also acquire malik - makbuza rights. Provision is made for reservation of grazing lands and for the collection of land revenue. Similar provisions are made in Chapter VII in respect of management and tenures of land in the merged territories. Chapter VIII deals with management and tenures of lands in Berar. Separate provision has been made for the determination of compensation payable to lessees of mines and minerals. Under the provisions of section 218 of the Central Provinces Land Revenue Act and Section 44 of the Berar Land Revenue Code there is a presumption that all mines and minerals belong to the State and the proprietary rights in them could be granted by the State to any person. Wherever a right of minerals has been so assigned, provision has been made regarding its acquisition and the consequences as resulting from such acquisition. The Act provides for the giving of rehabilitation grant to expropriated proprietors within a certain range provided for in Schedule III. The last chapter in the Act deals with miscellaneous matters including the power of making rules. The main purpose of the Act is to bring the actual tillers of the soil in direct contract with the State by the elimination of intermediary holders. In short, the Act aims at converting malguzari into ryotwari land system. In also aims at giving to the gram panchayats the management of common lands freed from the grip of proprietors and contemplates the establishment of self-government for the villages. The provisions of the Act in respect of payment of compensation, though they do not in any way provide for an equivalent in money of the property taken and in that sense may not be adequate cannot be called illusory.  This Act is a definite improvement on the Bihar Act it leaves the arrears of rents due in the hands of the proprietors and does not operate artificially to reduce the net income by any device. It also provides that in no case the net income should be reduced below five per cent of the gross income. The result is that in every case some amount of money becomes payable by the State by way of compensation to the proprietor and in no case does the compensation work into a negative sum or to a mere zero or a minus figure. In other respects the provisions of the Act in regard to compensation follow the pattern which is common to all zamindari legislation, which is to inflate the amount of expenditure and deflate the actual income. The siwai income from jalkar, bankar, etc. and from village forests is calculated at two times the siwai income recorded in the settlement made in 1923. This is Act was passed in 1951. The siwai income recorded in the year 1923 is appreciably less than the actual income of the properties from these sources in 1951. Similarly the income from consent money has to be calculated by taking the average income for ten years preceding the date of vesting and not the actual income as in the case of rent realized during the previous agricultural year. The expenditure has been inflated by taking in respect of the big forests the average income-tax paid during the period of thirty agricultural years. No agricultural income-tax existed during most of this period. It only came into existence recently. The cost of management has been calculated at a flat rate of eight to fifteen per cent. There can therefore be no doubt that the principles laid down for determination of compensation cannot be called equitable and they do not provided for payment of just compensation to the expropriated proprietor. The Petitioners case is that under the formula stated in the Act, a compensation of 25 lakhs which would be due to him on he basis of the value of property taken, has been reduced to a sum of Rs. 65,000 and is payable in thirty unspecified instalments and therefore it is purely nominal and illusory. This figure of Rs. 65,000 is arrived at by the following process -  Gross income from rents. Rs. 55,000  Siwai income Rs. 80,500 Actually (according to the affidavit the petitioner was realizing 4,65,000 from this source). Total 1,35,000 Deductions permissible under the Act are the following -  Revenue 45,000  Income-tax on 30 years average 66,600  Cost of management 21,000 Total ------- 1,32,600 Net income 2,400  Ten times net income would be Rs. 24,000 but as the net income cannot be reduced below five per cent. of the gross income which comes to Rs. 6500, compensation payable is Rs. 65,000 while the yearly income of the petitioner was in the neighbourhood of Rs. 5,65,000 and the market value of his property is 25 lakhs. The first and the main objection to the validity of the Act taken by the learned counsel is that the Bill was never passed into law. As already indicated, this objection is founded on the omission from the proceedings of the Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly dated the 5th April, 1950, of a statement to the effect that the Bill was put to the House by the speaker and was passed by it. Reference was made to rules 20,22, 34 and 115 of the rules regulating the procedure of the legislature framed under the Government of India Act, 1935, in the year 1936, which provides as follows -  20 (1). A matter requiring the decision of the Assembly shall be decided by means of a question put by the Speaker on a motion made by a member  After a motion has been made, the speaker shall read the motion for the consideration of the Assembly. 34 (1) Votes may be taken by voices or division and shall be taken by division if any member so desires. The Speaker shall determine the method of taking votes by division. The result of a division shall be announced by the Speaker and shall not be challenged. 115 (1) The Secretary shall cause to be prepared a full report of the proceedings of the Assembly at each of its meetings and publish it as soon as practicable. One impression of this printed report shall be submitted to the Speaker for his confirmation and signature and when signed shall constitute the authentic record of the proceedings of the Assembly. It was urged that the authentic report of the proceedings of the Assembly was conclusive on the point, that the Bill was not put to the Assembly by means of a question and was not voted upon, and hence it could not be said to have been passed by the legislature. It was said that even if there was no open opposition to the passing of the Bill, it was possible that if it was put to the Assembly, it might have rejected it. As already pointed out, the proceedings were signed by the Speaker on the 1st October, 1950, while the certificate that the Bill was passed was recorded by him on the original Bill when it was submitted to the President for his assent on the 10th May, 1950.  The certificate of the Speaker is conclusive on the point that the Bill was passed by the legislature (Vide Craies Statute Law, 4th Edn., p. 36). It seems to me that by an oversight it was not recorded in the proceedings that the mission was put to and passed by the House and the Speaker while signing the proceedings six months after the event failed to notice the error. There can be no about that the sense of the House on the 5th April, 1950, was for passing the Bill and there was no one present who was for rejecting it. The motion before the House that the Bill be passed. The Speaker could not possibly have appended a certificate on a Bill that it was passed by the House if it had not been so passed. There are no grounds whatever for doubting the correctness of his certificate. In my opinion the contention raised that the Bill was not passed into law fails and must be rejected. Next it is contended that articles 31-A and 31-B have no application to this Bill as it never became law by following the procedure prescribed in the Constitution and that those articles have only application to a Bill that had becomes an Act. The Legislature of Madhya Pradesh consists of the Governor and the Legislative Assembly. It was said that even if the Bill was passed by the Legislative Assembly, it was not assented to by the Governor but was straightway sent to the President and that without the assent of the Governor the Bill could not become law despite the fact that it was assented to by the President and it was pointed out that sub-clause (3) of article 31 of the Constitution speaks of law being reserved for the consideration of President and not merely a Bill.  This argument, in my opinion, has not much force having regard to the terms and scope of article 200. The Governor under that article could assent to a Bill or could reserve it for the consideration of the President at his option. The Governor being empowered to reserve the Bill for the consideration of the President and this having been done, it was for the President either to assent to the Bill or to withhold his assent. The President having given his assent, the Bill must be held to have been passed into law. It does not seem to have been intended that the Governor should give his assent to the Bill and make it a full-fledged law and then reserve it for the Presidents consideration so that it may have effect. Mr. Somayya pressed the point that the President could not perform both his functions under article 200 and article 31(4) concerning this Bill at one and the same time, that first the procedure laid down in article 200 for the passing of the Bill in to law should been followed, i.e. the Governor should have either assented to the Bill or should have reserved it for the consideration of the President and if it was so reserved, the President should then have given his assent and the Bill would then become law, that after the Bill had become law, the Governor should again have reserved this Bill for the consideration of the President as required by the provisions of article 31(3) in order to make it effective law against the provision of article 31(2) and that if the President then gave his assent, the law so assented to could not be called in question in a court of law.  It was said that only in case where this double procedure is followed that it could be said that the President had satisfied himself that the law did not contravene the provisions of article 31(2). In my opinion, the argument is fallacious. It would be a meaningless formality for the President to give his assent to the same Bill twice over. I cannot see why the President cannot perform both the duties entrusted to him by articles 200 and 31(3) and (4) at one the same time. He is not disabled under the Constitution from applying his mind to such a Bill once and for all to see whether it has to be passed into law and whether it fulfils the requirements of article 31(2). The Presidents assent therefore to the Bill attracts the application of articles 31-A and 31-B to it and deprives persons affected by it of the rights guaranteed in Part III of the Constitution. The Provisions of article 31(4) support the view of the learned Attorney-General that what has to be sent to the President is the Bill as passed by the legislature and not the Bill after it has been assented to by the Governor. The article reads thus - If any Bill pending at the commencement of this Constitution in the Legislature of a State has, after it has been passed by such Legislature been reversed for the consideration of the President and has received his assent, them notwithstanding anything in this Constitution, the law so assented to shall not be called in question in any court on the ground that it contravenes the provisions of clause (2). In this context the word Legislature means the House or Houses of Legislature and does not include the Governor with in its ambit. This word has not the same meaning in all the articles. In some articles it means the Governor as well as the Houses of Legislature, while in a number of other articles it only means the House or Houses of Legislature. Article 31(4) means that if any Bill contravening the provisions of clause (2) of article 31 is passed by the House or Houses of Legislature but is reserved for he consideration of the President and receives his assent, then it shall become law, not open to any objection on the ground of such contravention. Next it was contended that the obligation to pay compensation was implicit in the legislative power contained in entry 36 of List II and that the Act was unconstitutional as it had provided for acquisition of zamindaris without payment of compensation, the provisions relating to it being illusory.  This contention fails for the reasons given in my judgment in the Bihar case. Moreover, the compensation provided for in the impugned Act cannot be dubbed as illusory. All that can be said is that it is grossly inadequate and it is not the equivalent of the value of the property acquired, but this issue is not justiciable in view of the provisions of article 31(4). This Bill was pending at the commencement of the Constitution, it was reserved for the consideration of the president and the President gave his assent to it. The conditions for the application of article 31(4) thus stand fulfilled. Besides the obstacle of article 31(4). two further hurdles, viz., of articles 31-A and 31-B introduced by the amendments to the Constitution, stand in the way of the petitioner and bar an enquiry into the question of the quantum of compensation. The contention that there is no public purpose behind the impugned Act has also to be repelled on the same reasoning as given by me in the Bihar case. The purpose behind the Act is to establish direct contact between tillers of the soil and the Government and to eliminate the intermediaries, as in the view of the Government this is for the welfare of the society as a whole. It is also the purpose of the Act to confer malik maqbuza status on occupancy tenants and improve their present position and to vest management of village affairs and cultivation in a democratic village body. It is too late in the day to contend that reform in this directions is not for general public benefit. The next argument of Mr. Somayya that the Act is a fraud on the Constitution in that in legislating under entry 42 of List III, it has legislated for non-payment of compensation has also to be repelled, for the reasons given in the Bihar case. Under the provisions of this Act compensation can in no case work out into a mere nothing. On the other hand, in every case some amount of compensation is payable and in the majority of cases it is also not inadequate, Mr. Somayya contended that payment of Rs. 65,000 as compensation to his client for property worth twenty-five lakhs of rupees was purely illusory.  The assessment of value by the petitioner cannot be taken at its full value. It cannot at any rate be held that legislation which provides for the payment of a sum of Rs. 65,000 provides for no compensation. The amount of instalments, if payment is to be in instalments, is bound to be fixed by the rules made under the statute and in case the rules are so made that they amount to an abuse of the exercise of that power, they can always be challenged on that ground. The argument that the Act is bad inasmuch as it delegates essential legislative power to the executive is negatived for the reasons given in the Bihar case. A point was raised that the constitutional amendments in articles 31-A and 31-B could not affect the petitioners guaranteed rights contained in Part III of the Constitution in so far as the eighty malguzari villages were concerned, because those mahals did not fall within, the ambit of the word estate as defined in article 31-A. In sub-clause (2) (a) the definition is in these terms - The expression estate shall, in relation to any local area, have the same meaning as that expression or its local equivalent has in the existing law relating to land tenures in force in that area, and shall also include any jagir, inam or muafi or other similar grant. Section 2 (3) of Act II of 1917, C. P. Land Revenue Act, defines the expression estate thus - an estate as declared by the State Government. The learned Advocate - General conceded that these villages are not within the ambit of this definition but he contended that they are within the scope of the definition of the expression given in article 31-A, as mahals in Central Provisions are local equivalents of the expression estate, though not so declared by the Act. There is nothing on the record to support this contention. The contention that those eighty mahals are not an estateand are thus excluded from the reach of article 31-A does not, however very much advances the petitioners case, because the hurdles created in his way by articles 31-B and 31(4) stand in spite of the circumstances that article 31-A has no application. It was contended that article 31-B was merely illustrative of the rule stated in article 31-A and if article 31-A had no application, that article also should be left out of consideration. Reference was made to the decision of the Privy Council in King Emperor v. Sibnath Banerjee ((1945) L.R. 72 I.A. 241 1945 F.C.R. 195), on the construction of sub-sections (1) and (2) of section 2 of the Defence of India Act. The material portion of section 2 considered in that case runs thus -  (1). The Central Government may, be notification in the official gazette, make such rules as appear to it to be necessary or expedient for securing the defence of Birth India, the Public safety, the maintenance of public order or the efficient prosecution of war, or for maintaining supplies and services essential to the life of the community. (2) without prejudice to the generality of the powers conferred by sub-section (1), the rule may provide for, or may, empower any authority to make orders providing for all any of the following matters, namely  Their Lordships made the following observations about the meaning to be given to the language of sub-section (2) -- the function of sub - section (2) is merely an illustrative one the rule-making, power is conferred by sub-section (1), and the rules which are referred to in the opening sentence of sub-section (2) are the rules which are authorised by, and made under, sub-section (1) the provisions of sub-section (2) are not restrictive of sub-section (1), as indeed is expressly stated by the words without prejudice to the generality of the power conferred by sub-section (1). Article 31-B is in these terms -  Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions continued in article in article 31-A n"
104.0,Land Dispute,"CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION Civil Appeal No. 108 of 1952. Appeal from the Judgment and Decree dated the 29th March, 1950, of the High Court of Judicature at Calcutta in Appeal from Original Decree No. 121 of 1945 arising from the Decree dated the 22nd December, 1944, of the Court of Subordinate Judge at Alipore, in Title Suit No. 70 of 1941. C. Chatterjee (C. N. Laik, D. N. Mukherjee and Sukumar Ghose, with him) for the appellants. P. Sinha (B.B. Haldar and S. C. Bannerji, with him) for respondents Nos. I to 3. 1954. May 21. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by MUKHERJEA J.-This appeal, which has come before us, on a certificate granted by the High Court of Calcutta, under article 133(1) of the Constitution, is directed against a judgment and decree of a Division Bench of that Court dated the 29th March, 1950, affirming, on appeal, those of the Subordinate Judge, Fourth Court, Alipore, passed in Title Suit. No. 70 of 1941. The appellants before us are the heirs and legal representatives of the original defendant No. 3 in the suit, which was commenced by the plaintiffs respondents to recover possession of the property in dispute, on establishment of their title, as reversionary heirs of one Haripada Patra, after the death of his mother Rashmoni, who got the property in the restricted rights of a Hindu female heir on Haripadas death. To appreciate the contentions that have been raised by the parties to this appeal it would be necessary to narrate the material facts in chronological order. The property in suit which is premises No. 6 Dwarik Ghoses Lane situated in the suburb of Calcutta admittedly formed part of the estate of one Mahendra Narayan Patra, a Hindu inhabitant of Bengal, owning considerable properties, who died on the 17th April, 1903, leaving him surviving his widow Rashmoni, two infant sons by her, Mohini Mohan and Haripada and a grandson Ram Narayan by a predeceased son Shyama Charan. Shyama Charan was the son of Mahendra by his first wife, who died during his lifetime. On the 17th February, 1901, Mahendra executed a will by which he made certain religious and charitable dispositions and subject. to them, directed his properties to be divided amongst his infant sons Mohini and Haripada and his grandson Ram Narayan. Ram Narayan was appointed executor under the will. After the death of Mahendra, Ram Narayan applied for probate of the will and probate was obtained by him on the 6th of October, 1904, Ram Narayan entered upon the management of the estate. He developed extravagant and immoral habits and soon ran into debts. The bulk of the properties were mortgaged to one Kironsashi who having obtained a decree on the mortgage applied for sale of the mortgaged properties. Thereupon Rashmoni on behalf of her infant sons instituted a suit against the mortgagee and the mortgagor and got a declaration that the mortgage decree could not bind the infants shares in the properties left by their father. This judgment was given on the 31st March, 1909. On the 13th August, 1909, the two infant sons of Mahendra to wit Mohini and Haripada, by their mother and next friend Rashmoni, instituted a suit in the Court of the Subordinate Judge at Alipore, being Title Suit No. 45 of 1909, claiming administration of the estate left by Mahendra as well as partition and accounts on the basis of the will left by him. On the 14th of August, 1909, one Baroda Kanta Sarkar, Sheristadar of the Court of the District Judge, Alipore, was appointed, with the consent of both parties, receiver of the estate forming the subject-matter of the litigation. The receiver took possession of the properties immediately after this order was made. The -management by the receiver, as it appears, was not at all proper or beneficial to the interest of the two sons of Mahendra. Mahendra himself left no debts and whatever debts were contracted,, were contracted by Ram Narayan to meet his own immoral and extravagant expenses. The receiver however went on borrowing large gums of money upon ex-parte orders received from the Court, the ostensible object of which was to pay off the debts due by Ram Narayan which were not at all binding on the plaintiffs. Fearing that the longer the suit continued and the properties remained in the hands of the receiver the more harmful it- would be to the interests of the minors, Rashmoni on behalf of the minors compromised the suit. with Ram Narayan and a Solenama was filed on the 13th June, 1910. The terms of the compromise, in substance, were, that the properties in suit were to be held in divided shares between the three parties and specific allotments were made in favour of each, the properties allotted to the share of Haripada being specified in schedules Gha and Chha attached to the compromise petition. It was further provided that the receiver would be discharged on submitting his final accounts. It may be mentioned here that the property which is the subject-matter of the present suit was, under the Solenama, allotted to the share of Haripada. On the very day that the compromise was filed, Rashmoni applied for discharge of the receiver. The Court made an order directing the receiver to submit his final accounts within one month, or as early as possible, when the - necessary order for discharge would be made. It was further directed that as the suit was disposed of on compromise the receiver should discontinue collecting rents and profits due to the estate from that day. This order however was modified by a subsequent order made on 23rd June, 19 10, which directed that the receiver was to continue in possession of the estate until he was paid whatever was due to him for his ordinary commission and allowances and until the parties deposited in Court the amounts borrowed by the receiver under orders of the Court or in the alternative gave sufficient indemnity for the same. After this, Rashmoni on behalf of her minor sons filed two successive applications before the Subordinate Judge praying for permission to raise by mortgage, of a part of the estate, the moneys necessary for releasing the estate from the hands of the receiver. The first application was rejected and the second was granted, after it was brought to the notice of the Subordinate Judge that the receiver was attempting to dissuade prospective lenders who were approached on behalf of Rashmoni, to lend any money to her. On the 16th of January, 191 1, Haripada, the younger son of Rashmoni, died and his interest devolved upon his mother as his heir under the Hindu law. On the 28th January, 1911, the following order was recorded by the Suborainate Judge The receiver has filed a statement showing the amount as due to him up to the end of the. current month. This claim amounts to Rs. 20,950-2-6 pies only. The parties may deposit the sum on or before the 1st February next in Court and on such deposit the receiver will be discharged and the possession of the estate of late Mahendr Narayan Patra, will be made over to the parties. On the very same day Mohini exectued a mortgage (Ex. M-1) in favour of one Suhasini Dasi by which he hypothecated the properties allotted to his share and also his future interest as reversions to the share of Haripada, to secure an advance of Rs. 30,000. The loan was to carry interest at the rate of 18 per annum. One thing may be mentioned in connection with this mortgage, and that is, that amongst the properties included in the mortgage were two properties, namely, premises No. 15/1 and 16 Chetlahat Road, which had already been sold and to which the mortgagor bad no title at the date of the mortgage. On the 1st February, 1911, Mohini deposited in Court the sum of Rs. 2,0,950-2-6 pies, being the amount alleged to. be due to the receiver and the Court by an order passed on that date directed the release of the estate from the hands of the receiver. After the estate was released a petition was filed on behalf of the plaintiffs on the 15th February, 1911, praying that the loans said to be contracted by the receiver should not be paid out of the money deposited in Court, as these borrowings were made not for the protection of the estate but only for the personal benefit of the defendant, Ram Narayan, and to pay off his creditors. It was contended that the loans raised by the receiver were not raised in good faith, after proper notice to the plaintiffs but on the strength of orders which he obtained ex-parte from the Subordinate Judge without disclosing the material facts. This application. was rejected by the Court on the 23rd February,1911. After this order was made,the plaintiffs put in a petition praying that payment of the moneys, due to the creditor- with the exception of what was necessary to pay off one of the creditors, named Rakhal Das Adhya, be stayed till the following Monday as the plaintiffs wanted to move the High Court against the order of the Subordinate Judge mentioned above. The Court granted this prayer and on the 2nd of March following, orders were received from the High Court directing that the moneys were to be detained in Court pending further orders. The High Court made order on the plaintiff s petition on the 29th May, 1911. The learned Judges were very critical of the appointment of the Sheristadar of the Court as receiver of the estate and in no measured terms blamed the Subordinate Judge for passing ex-parte, orders for raising loans on the applications of the receiver without any investigation at all and the receiver also for borrowing money not for the benefit of the estate but for the personal benefit of Ram Narayan, the defendant. The High Court directed a full and proper investigation of the accounts of the receiver by a Commissioner and a Vakil of the High Court was appointed for that purpose. The Commissioner after a protracted enquiry submitted his report which was accepted by the High Court. Under the final orders passed by the High Court not only were the plaintiffs held not liable to pay any money to the receiver but the receiver was directed to pay a sum of Rs. 6,708 to the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs were also to-receive Rs. 4,084 from the defendant, Ram Narayan. The defendant was to pay Rs. 19,124 to the receiver and the receiver wag made personally liable for the loans that he had incurred. This order was made on the 23rd July, 1913. In the meantime while the investigation of accounts were going on under orders of the High Court, Rashmoni, together with her son Mohini executed a security bond -(Ex. E-1) on the 1st August, 1911, and it is upon the legal effect of this document that the decision of this case practically depends. By this security bond, which was executed in favour of Suhasini Dasi, the mortgagee in the mortgage bond of Mohini, Rashmoni purported to hypothecate all the properties that she got as heir of Haripada, as additional security for the loan of Rs. 30,000 already advanced to Mohini under the mortgage. As is stated already, two properties situated at Chetla were included in the mortgage of Mohini although they were already sold. The security bond recites that the mortgagee having discovered this fact was about to Institute legal proceedings against the mortgagor and it was primarily to ward off these threatened proceedings and remove any apprehension from the minds of the mortgagee about the sufficiency of the security that this bond was executed. It is further stated in the bond that the estate of Haripada in the hands of his mother was benefited by the deposit of Rs. 20,950 in Court by Mohini Mohan out of the sum of Rs. 30,000 borrowed on the mortgage and that Mohini had spent the remaining amount of the loan towards clearing certain debts of Rashmoni herself and to meet the litigation and other expenses of both of them. Mohini died soon after on the 8th of November, 1911. On October 13, 1917, Suhasini instituted a suit for enforcing the mortgage and the security bond against Rashmoni and the heirs of Mohini. preliminary decree was passed on compromise in that suit on the 24th September, 1918, and on the 25th July, 1919, the decree was made final. The decree was put into execution and on the 15th September, 1919, along with other properties, the property in dispute was put up to sale and it was purchased by Annada Prasad Ghose for Rs. 13,500. On the 14th November, 1919, Bhubaneswari, wife of Ram Narayan, as guardian of her infant sons filed a suit, being Title Suit No. 254 of 1919 against Suhasini, Rashmoni and Annada attacking the validity of the mortgage decree obtained by Suhasini as well as the sale in execution thereof. The suit ended on the 6th July, 1921, and the plaintiff gave up her claim. On September 5, 1922, Annada Ghose borrowed a sum of Rs. 10,000 from Sarat Kumar Das, the original defendant No. 3 in, the suit and the father of the present appellants and by way of equitable mortgage deposited with the lender the title deeds of the property No. 6, Dwarik Ghose Lane. On the 14th September, 1925, Annada sold the property by executing a conveyance in favour of the mortgagee Sarat Kumar Das for a consideration of Rs. 15,500. On the 8th June, 1939, Rashmoni died. About a year later on July 15, 1940, the three sons of Ram Narayan, who are the reversionary heirs of Haripada after the death of Rashmoni, commenced the present suit in the Court of the Subordinate Judge at Alipore claiming to recover possession of the property on the allegation, that the security bond executed by Rashmoni not being supported by legal necessity, the sale in execution of the mortgage as well as the subsequent conveyance in favour of Sarat Kumar Das could pass only the right, title and interest of Rashmoni and could not affect the reversionary rights of the plaintiffs. Several other persons were impleaded as parties defendants and a number of issues were raised with which we are not concerned in this appeal. What concerns us in this appeal is the dispute between the plaintiffs on the one hand and defendant No. 3 on the other and this dispute centered. round three points, namely,  Whether the security bond (Ex. E-1) executed by Rashmoni along with Mohini was executed for legal, necessity and was therefore binding on the reversioners, of Haripada after the death of Rashmoni ? Whether the fact that Mohini, who was the presumptive reversioner at that time, joined with his mother in executing the security bond would make it binding on the -,actual reversioner after the death of Rashmomi? In any event if such consent on the part of the presumptive reversioner raised a presumption of legal necessity, was that presumption rebutted in the present case by the evidence adduced by the parties ? Whether the title of defendant No. I was protected ,he being a stranger purchaser who had purchased the -property from the purchaser at an execution sale after making proper enquiries and obtaining legal advice ? The trial Judge by his judgment dated the 22nd December, 1944, decided all these points in favour of the plaintiffs and decreed the suit. On appeal by the defendant to the High Court, the decision of the trial Judge was affirmed. The heirs of defendant No.3 have now come up to this Court and Mr. Chatterjee appearing in support of the appeal has reiterated all the three points which were urged on behalf of his clients in the Courts below. On the first point both the Courts below have held concurrently, that there was absolutely no legal necessity which justified the execution of the security bond by Rashmoni in favour of Suhasini. Mr. Chatterjee lays stress on the fact that it was a matter of imperative necessity for both the plaintiffs to get back the estate of their father from the hands of the receiver as the debts contracted by the receiver were mounting Up day after day. It is pointed out that on the 28th January, 1911, the Court had made a peremptory order to the effect that the properties could be released only if the plaintiffs deposited Rs. 20,950 annas odd on or before the 1st February next.  In order to comply with this order Mohini had no other alternative but to borrow- money on the mortgage of his properties and this he had to do before the 1st February, 1911. It is true that because of the unfortunate death of Haripada only a few days before, Rashmoni could not join in executing the mortgage but she, as heir of Haripada, was really answerable for half of the money that was required to be deposited in Court. It is said that this was not a mere moral obligation but a legal liability on the part of the lady, as Mohini could have claimed contribution from her to the extent that Haripadas estate was benefited by the deposit. The execution of the security bond therefore was an act beneficial to the estate of Haripada. The contentions, though somewhat plausible at first sight, seem to us to be wholly without substance. In the first place the money borrowed by Mohini or deposited by him in Court did not and could not benefit Haripadas estate at all. As was found, on investigation of accounts, under orders of the High Court later on, nothing at all was due to the receiver by the estate of Haripada or Mohini. On the other hand, both the brothers were entitled to get a fairly large sum of money from the receiver.  The trial Judge found that there was no urgent necessity to borrow money for releasing the estate and in fact it was Mohini who acted in hot haste to execute the mortgage, his only object being to get the properties in his own hands. It may be, that it was not possible to know the actual state of affairs with regard to the receivers accounts and consequently it might well have been thought prudent to borrow money to ward off what was considered to be a danger to the estate. This might furnish some excuse or explanation for Mohinis borrowing money on the 28th January, 191 1, but that could not make the act of Rashmoni in executing the security bond, seven months after that event, an act of prudent management on her part dictated either by legal necessity or considerations of benefit to the estate of her deceased son In the first place it is to be noted-that the total amount borrowed by Mohini was Rs. 30,000 out of which Rs. 20,950 only were required to be deposited in Court. The recital in the security bond that the rest of the money was spent by, Mohini to pay off certain debts of Rashmoni herself and also to meet the litigation and household expenses of both of them has been held by the Subordinate Judge to be false. It has been found on facts that Rashmoni had no occasion to incur any debts either for litigation expenses or for any other purpose. But the most important thing that would require consideration is the state of things actually existing at the time when the security bond was executed. Even if the release of the estate was considered to be desirable, that had been already accomplished by Mohini who borrowed money on his own responsibility. The utmost that could be said was that Rashmoni was bound to reimburse Mohini to the extent that the deposit of money by Mohini had benefited the estate of Haripada.  The High Court has rightly pointed out that Rashmoni did not execute the bond to raise any money to pay off her share of the deposit and in fact no necessity for raising money for that purpose at all existed at that time. As has been mentioned already, by an order passed by the High Court on the revision petition of Mohini and his mother against the order of the Subordinate Judge dated the 23rd February, 191 1, the whole amount of money deposited in Court on the 1st, February, 191 1, with the exception of a small sum that was paid to a creditor, with the consent of both parties, was detained in Court. The High Court dispos- ed of the revision case on 29th May, 1611, and directed investigation into the accounts of the receiver by a Commissioner appointed by it. As said already, the Court passed severe strictures on the conduct of the receiver as well as of the Subordinate Judge and plainly indicated that the moneys borrowed by the receiver were borrowed not for the benefit of the plaintiffs at all. Undoubtedly the accounts were still to be investigated but what necessity there possibly could be for Rashmoni to execute, after the High Court had made the order as stated above, a security bond by which she mortgaged all the properties that were allotted to Haripada in his share as an additional security for the entire loan of Rs. 30,000 no portion of which be defied the estate of Haripada at all? In our opinion the only object of executing the security bond was to protect Mohini who was threatened with legal proceedings by his creditor for having included a nonexistent property in the mortgage bond. Rashmoni certainly acted at the instance of and for the benefit of Mohini and she might have been actuated by a feeling of Maternal affection to save her son from a real or imaginary danger. But by no stretch of imagination could it be regarded as a prudent act on the part of a Hindu female heir which was necessary for the protection of the estate of the last male holder. In our opinion the view taken by the Courts below is quite proper and as a concurrent finding of fact it should not be disturbed by this Court. The second point urged by Mr. Chatterjee raises the question as to whether the fact of Mohinis joining his mother in executing the security bond would make the transaction binding on the actual reversioner, Mohini being admittedly the presumptive reversioner of Haripada at the date of the transaction. We do not think that there could be any serious controversy about the law on this point. The alienation here, was by way of mortgage and so no question of surrender could possibly arise.  Mohini being the immediate reversioner who joined in the execution of the security bond must be deemed to have consented to the transaction. Such consent may raise a presumption that the transaction was for legal necessity or that the mortgagee had acted therein after proper and bona flde enquiry and has satisfied himself as to the existence of such necessity(1). But this. presumption is rebuttable and it is open to the actual reversioner to establish that there was in fact no legal necessity and there has been no proper and bonafide enquiry by the mortgagee. There is no doubt that both the Courts below have proceeded on a correct view of law and both have come to the conclusion upon a consideration of the evidence in the case that the presumption that arose by reason of the then reversioners giving consent to the transaction was rebutted by the facts transpiring in evidence. Mr. Chatterjee placed considerable reliance upon another document which purports to be a deed of declaration and was executed by Ram Narayan on the 5th of October, 1918. At this time Mohini was dead and Ram Narayan was the immediate reversioner to the estate of Haripada and by this deed he declared inter alia that the debts contracted by Rashmoni were for proper and legal necessity. This deed purports to be addressed to Bangshidari Ghosh and Keshav Dutt, two other alienees of the properties of Mohini and Haripada and does not amount to a representation made to the auction purchaser Annada Prasad Ghose or to the father of the present appellants. In fact they had not come in the picture at all at that time. At the most it can be regarded only as an admission by a presumptive reversioner and cannot have any higher value than the consent expressed by Mohini who figured as a co-execuitant of the security bond. It cannot bind the actual reversioner in any way. Mr. Chatterjee attempted to put forward an argument on the authority of certain observations in the case of Bajrangi v. Monokarnika(2) that as the present appellants are the sons of Ram Narayan the admissions made by their father would bind them as well. It is true that there is a passage at the end of the judgment in Monokarnikas case(1) which lends some apparent support to the contention of the learned counsel. The concluding words in the judgment stand as follows  Vide Debi Prosad Chowdhury v. Golap Bhagat, I.L.R. 40 Cal. 721 at 78I. Approved of by the judicial Committee in Gounden v. Gounden, 46 I.A. 72, 84. (2) 35 I.A. 1. The appellants who claim through Matadin Singh and Baijnath Singh must be held bound by the consent of their fathers. But the true import of this passage was discussed by the Privy Council in their later pronouncement in Rangasami Gounden v. Nachippa Gounden(1) and it was held that the words referred to above should I not be construed to lay down the proposition that such consent on the part of the father would operate proprio vigore and would be binding on the sons. This proposition, Their Lordships observed, was opposed both to principle and authority, it being a settled doctrine of Hindu law that nobody has a vested right so long as the widow is alive and the eventual reversioner does not claim through anyone who went before him. As the sons of Ram Narayan claim as heirs of Haripada and not of their father, the admissions, if any, made by the latter could not in any way bind them. This contention of the appellant must therefore fail. The third and the last contention raised by Mr. Chatterjee is that in any event his client is a stranger who has bona fide purchased the property for good consideration after making due enquiries and on proper legal advice and be cannot therefore be affected by any infirmity of title by reason of the absence of legal necessity. In our opinion the contention formulated in this form really involves a misconception of the legal position of an alienee of a Hindu widows property. The interest of a Hindu widow in the pro- perties inherited by her bears no analogy or resemblance to what may be described as an equitable estate in English law and which cannot be followed in the hands of a bonafide purchaser for value without notice. From very early times the Hindu widows estate has been described as qualified proprietorship with powers of alienation only when there is justifying necessity, and the restrictions on the powers of alienation are inseparable from her estate (2). For legal necessity she can convey to another an absolute title to the property vested in her. If there is no legal necessity, the transferee gets only the widows estate which is not even an (1) 46 I.A. 72 at 83-84. Vide The Collector of Masaulipatam v. Cavaly Venkata,  M.I.A. 529, indefeasible life estate for it can come to an end not merely on her death but on the happening of other contingencies like re-marriage, adoption, etc. If an alienee from a Hindu widow succeeds in establishing that there was legal necessity for transfer, he is completely protected and it is immaterial that the necessity was brought about by the mismanagement of the limited owner herself. Even if there is no necessity in fact, but it is proved that there was representation of necessity and the alienee after making bona fide enquiries satisfied himself as best as he could that such necessity existed, then as the Privy Council pointed out in Hunooman Persaud Pandays case (1) the actual existence of a legal necessity is not a condition precedent to the validity of the sale. The position therefore is that if there is no necessity in fact or if the alienee could not prove that he made bona fide enquiries and was satisfied about its existence, the transfer is undoubtedly not void but the transferee would get only the widows estate in the property which does not affect in any way the interest of the reversioner. In this case the alienation was by way of mortgage. The finding of both the Courts below is that there was no legal necessity which justified the execution of the security bond. The mortgagee also could not prove that there was representation of the legal necessity and that she satisfied herself by bona fide enquiries that such necessity did exist. On this point the, finding recorded by the High Court is as follows  In the present case, there is no scope for an argument that there was such representation of legal necessity or that on bona fide enquiry the alienee satisfied herself that there was such a necessity, for as I have already pointed out the security bond itself states that it was in consideration of benefits already received and with a view to induce Suhasini to forbear from proceeding against Mohini, that the bond was being executed. There is no representation in the bond that the alienation was made with a view to securing any benefit to the estate or to avert any danger to the estate or for the purpose of any other legal necessity. Whatever enquiries the appellants may have made (1) 6 M.I.A, would be of no avail to them when the alienation is not binding on the whole estate but only on the womans estate of Rashmoni. In our opinion the view taken by the High Court is quite proper. On this finding the security bond could operate only on the widows estate of Rashmoni and it was that interest alone which passed to the purchase. at the mortgage sale. The subsequent transferee could not claim to have acquired any higher right than what his predecessor had and it is immaterial whether he bona fide paid the purchase money or took proper legal advice. DECISION ??"
105.0,Land Dispute,"The suit was filed by the present appellants for a declaration of their title to 136 odd bighas of Ryotikasht lands and for possession thereof either exclusively or jointly with the defendants. A claim for mesne profits and interest was also made. The suit was decreed by the Subordinate Judge, Motihari, on the ground that the defendants were in possession of the suit lands as benamidars. The trial Judge found that the consideration for the acquisition of these lands had proceeded from the predecessor of the plaintiffs, who had acquired them in the farzi names of Prahlad Rai, Gulraj Rai and Nawrang Rai. He also held that the benamidars were related to Radhumal by marriage, and that Radhumal found it convenient to use their names. These findings were accepted by the present respondents in the High Court. They, however, raised before the High Court certain contentions found against them by the trial Judge. In the plaint, the appellants had given their reasons for acquiring the property benami in the names of Prahlad Rai, Gulraj Rai and Nawrang Rai. They had stated that, according to the terms of the lease, ryoti lands taken in the names of the lessee or his relatives and servants were liable to be resumed by the Bettiah Raj after the termination of the lease, and that the benami transaction was entered into to avoid this contingency. The answering respondents, therefore, contended in the Court of First Instance that the predecessor of the appellants had caused these lands to be settled by the Bettiah Raj benami in their names to effectuate a fraud upon the Bettiah Raj, and the fraud having succeeded, the plaintiffs-appellants were not entitled to a judgment. They also contended that after the termination of the lease of the appellants with the Bettiah Raj these lands were settled or deemed to be settled with them. Both these grounds were accepted by the High Court. In this Court, the respondents have taken the same stand, and have also contended that the acquisition of these lands having been achieved by means of forging the signatures of Prahlad Rai, Gulraj Rai and Nawrang Rai, the present appellants are not entitled to a judgment on the application of the maxim, ex turpi causa non oritur actio. They, however, contend that if it be the view of the Court that both the parties had conspired to deceive the Bettiah Raj or were guilty of illegality, even then, potior est conditio defendantis. By the decisions of the two Courts below and the concession of the respondents, all questions of fact must be taken to be finally decided. The question as to whether the acquisition was benami or not cannot any longer be-reopened, and the case has therefore to be considered only with regard to the principles contained in the maxims above referred to and the fact whether there was any fraud intended on the Bettiah Raj and, if so, whether it was effected and who was responsible for it. Though the decision of the case may appear to lie within a very narrow compass, it is necessary to recount rather voluminous facts bearing upon the history of these acquisitions. On April 1, 1922, the manager of the Court of Wards, Bettiah Raj, granted a lease of village Bijbania for 10 years (Asin 1327 to Bhado 1336, vide Ex. 7, to Radhumal, who was the karta of the joint family now represented by the plaintiffs and Mahadeo, respondent 6. On June 26, 1931, the lease was renewed for a further period of 10 years (1337 to 1346). Two of the conditions of this lease will have to be referred to in the sequel, and may conveniently be quoted here for easy reference  Not to make any settlement of land with a raiyat or other tenant without the consent of the manager, and in any application for such consent to any settlement of land recorded as zirat or bakasht in the record of rights to state the reason of the lessee for wishing to make such settlement, and the area or zirat or bakasht land which would remain in the demised property after such settlement if it were made, and when it is proposed to make any settlement with a relative or servant of the lessee to state that fact and it is hereby declared that the manager shall be entitled as a condition of giving consent to any such settlement to require that an amount to be assessed by him shall be charged as a salami on any such settlement. Not to retain possession after the expiry of lease of any raiyati holdings or other interest in the leased property, acquired during the term of the lease whether by private purchase, purchase at auction sale, mortgage, sub-lease, surrender or otherwise, and any such holding or interest thus acquired will pass to the lessor, provided that the lessee will be entitled to receive from the lessor a sum equivalent to any loss he may have suffered by purchasing holdings at auction sales for arrears of rent, the loss to be calculated by setting against the purchase price the profits made by the lessee from the land since the date of purchase subject to any general instructions which may be issued by the Board of Revenue, the Manager will determine the amount to be received by the lessee under this clause, and his decisions will be final. Between the years 1920 to 1925 Radhumal acquired 136 odd bighas of lands, now the subject of dispute, in various ways. 94 odd bighas were purchased at Court sale, 7 odd bighas by private sales and 6 odd bighas were acquired by abandonment of tenancies by the previous tenants. These 136 odd bighas also included 27 odd bighas of lands, which are described as Ghair Mazrua, Patti Kadim and Kabil Lagon. These lands were settled with Prahlad Rai, Gulraj Rai and Nawrang Rai by the Bettiah Raj. The answering respondents are Prahlad Rai and the legal representatives of the other two. In settling these lands with these persons, Radhumal himself as lessee recommended them to the Bettiah Raj, and it is now proved and admitted in the case that he had also caused the signatures of these persons to be made upon the documents filed in the Bettiah Raj by others than the apparent signatories. As has been pointed out already, this device was resorted to, to avoid the operation of clause 16 of the lease quoted above. It was also used to reduce the salami payable to the Bettiah Raj under clause 4 which in the case of a stranger was lower than in the case of the lessee, his relatives and servants. The respondents had denied all these pleas, and had stated that the lands were settled with them by the Bettiah Raj, and that they were not the benamidars of Radhumal. They now rely upon the facts pleaded by the appellants in regard to the device resorted to, to save the lands from the operation of cls. 16 and 4 and further plead the illegal conduct of Radhumal in causing the signatures of Prahlad Rai, Gulraj Rai and Nawrang Rai to be forged on the documents filed with the Bettiah Raj. Radhumal died on February 28, 1934. After his death, Bala Prasad, appellant No. 3, was adopted, and the adoption was also recognised by the Bettiah Raj. The lease was also transferred to the name of Bala Prasad. In 1935, it is alleged the widow denied, at the instigation of Mahadeo, respondent 6, this adoption, and Mahadeo, in his turn, started to disclaim all interest in the property. The other respondents also began asserting their title against the heirs and representatives of Radhumal. It was also alleged that Mahadeo had removed all the kabalas and some of the receipts and had given them to Prahlad Rai, which were used by the answering respondents in all subsequent proceedings. In 1936, proceedings under s. 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure were commenced, which terminated in favour of Prahlad Rais party by an order of the Sub-Divisional Officer on June 4, 1936. The order of the Sub-Divisional Officer was, however, reversed by the District Magistrate, Champaran, and on revision to the High Court, the finding of the District Magistrate was reversed in its turn, though the rule itself was discharged. The High Court recommended the commencement of proceedings under s. 145 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, if there was any apprehension of breach of peace. These proceedings were commenced and finally terminated on May 18, 1942, by an order against the appellants, who were therefore compelled to bring this suit inasmuch as, according to them, the decision in the criminal courts cast a cloud upon their title. The main issue around which the controversy in the present case has revolved in the trial Court is the fifth, framed by the Subordinate Judge. It reads as follows Are the defendants farzidars of the plaintiffs in respect of the suit lands ? As we have already stated above, this issue has now been finally decided in favour of the appellants. The High Court has held that they are not entitled to a judgment in spite of this finding, on the ground that they had perpetrated a fraud upon the Bettiah Raj, and this fraud disentitles them to a judgment. The High Court has also stated that after the termination of the lease, the answering respondents must be deemed to be ryoti tenants of the Bettiah Raj, because rent was accepted from them and not from the lessee. One of the learned Judges of the High Court decided the case mainly on this ground, but the learned Chief Justice gave reasons on both the points. The learned Chief Justice also adverted to the fact that there were certain illegalities committed by Radhumal, which made the condition of the respondents stronger. We begin with the point about the creation of a new tenancy by the Bettiah Raj after the expiry of the lease granted to Radhumal. We may point out that this aspect of the case was not pleaded by the answering respondents, and it is difficult to accept this case, which requires fresh evidence and material for a finding. The case of the respondents was that they had taken settlement of these lands from the Bettiah Raj in the very beginning. There was no occasion, therefore, for a fresh settlement with them, and the plea that after the expiry of the lease there was, in fact, or there must be deemed in law, a fresh settlement with them, is not open to them. There is evidence in the case to show that B. H. forms were not issued once again after the expiry of the lease given to Radhumal. R. N. Prasad (P.W. 3) stated that a certified copy of the B. H. form under which land was settled with a ryoti tenant was issued to the settle for his information, and no such fresh B. H. forms have been produced by the respondents. In view of these two facts, we must say, with respect, that the High Court was in error in constructing a new case for the respondents. It is not open to a Court in appeal to consider media concludendi not pleaded by a party and to give judgment on their basis. This leaves over for consideration the two maxims and the question of fraud perpetrated upon the Bettiah Raj. The maxim, in pari delicto etc., can hardly be made applicable in this context. Neither the appellants nor the respondents at any time pleaded that Prahlad Rai, Gulraj Rai and Nawrang Rai conspired to effect a fraud upon the Bettiah Raj. In this respect, the cases of the appellants and the respondents are poles apart. While the appellants claim that Radhumal did not even consider it necessary to obtain the consent of these three persons and even did not obtain their signatures, the respondents claim that Radhumal had nothing whatever to do with the acquisition of these lands and had merely recommended them to the Bettiah Raj in his capacity as the lessee. Where both parties do not show that there was any conspiracy to defraud a third person or to commit any other illegal act, the maxim, in pari delicto etc., can hardly be made applicable. The appellants and the answering respondents were not in pari delicto. The respondents claimed to be innocent parties, who had acquired the lands themselves, and the appellants, on the other hand, stated that the respondents knew nothing about the matter and were not even consulted. In our opinion, the application of the maxim was erroneous. This leaves over for consideration firstly whether a fraud was effected upon the Bettiah Raj, and whether it was successful. The appellants contend that the Bettiah Raj was in full possession of the information that this was a benami transaction and salami was obtained to the tune of Rs. 1,680 and was waived only in respect of lands considered not worthy of demanding a salami. It is stated by the appellants in the evidence that the Bettiah Raj was informed about the benami nature of the transaction and Rai Bahadur Motilal Basu, the Assistant Manager of the Bettiah Raj, which was under the Court of Wards, was informed about this. R. H. Prasad (P.W. 3) stated that Rai Bahadur Moti Lal Basu was Assistant Manager of the Estate, and that he was an experienced officer. Narain Lal, (P.W. 17), deposed that in his presence Radhumal had told Moti Lal Basu that he was taking the settlements in the farzi names of his relations. It is also clear that in 1936 when the dispute went to the District Magistrate, Champar an, all these facts were set out in the rival cases of the parties - both under ss. 144 and 145 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The District Magistrate was an officer of the Court of Wards, and he knew by 1936 that the tenancies were taken benami by Radhumal. After the expiry of the lease, the Court of Wards did not enforce clause 16 in spite of this knowledge, and it therefore appears that the fraud was not effected, because the person or authority said to be defrauded knew all the facts, and elected not to take any action. There is nothing in the record beyond the statement of the appellants in the plaint to show that the salami was unduly low. On the other hand, the answering respondents claimed to have paid proper salami from their own funds. It has been held, however, that Radhumal paid the salami, a fact not now questioned. The rival admissions cancel each other and leave the matter at large. The matter was never put in issue except as to who paid the salami and the sufficiency or otherwise of the salami was never tried. In view of the fact that fraud cannot be said to have been effected, we do not think that the appellants who have clearly established the benami nature of the transactions can be deprived of their judgment. The authorities do not go to that length, because public policy demands that where fraud might have been contemplated but was not perpetrated, the defendants should not be allowed to perpetrate a new fraud. Coming now to the question whether the appellants suit was rightly dismissed by the High Court on the application of the maxim, ex turpi causa etc., we have first to see what are the specific facts on which this contention is based. The case of the appellants was that the property was taken benami in the names of Prahlad Rai and others to avid the implication of clause 16. In making the application to the Bettiah Raj the signatures of Prahlad Rai and others were made by Radhumal or some one under his instructions, because the relationship between Radhumal, Prahlad Rai and others was so intimate that it was considered unnecessary to trouble them. Inasmuch, as the matter was brought to the notice of the Assistant Manager of the Court of Wards, all these facts were capable of being investigated, including the making of the signatures by Radhumal. No doubt, the making of the signatures of another person without his consent, express or implied, is an offence under the ordinary law, but the intention was not so much to forge the signatures but to present the application in the names of those persons. However it be, we proceed on the assumption that there was some illegality committed by Radhumal in approaching the Bettiah Raj and also in the execution of the B.H. forms, which were also signed with the names of these persons. The question is whether this illegality is sufficient to non-suit the plaintiffs on the application of the maxim. The law was stated as far back as 1775 by Lord Mansfield in Holman v. Johnson (1775) 1 Cowp. 341, 343 98 E.R. 1120, 1121, in the following words The principle of public policy is this ex dolo malo non oritur actio. No Court will lend its aid to a man who founds his cause of action upon an immoral or an illegal act. If, from the plaintiffs own stating or otherwise, the cause of action appears to arise ex turpi causa, or the transgression of a positive law of this country, there the Court says he has no right to be assisted. It is upon that ground the Court goes not for the sake of the defendant, but because they will not lend their aid to such a plaintiff. So if the plaintiff and defendant were to change sides, and the defendant was to bring his action against the plaintiff, the latter would then have the advantage of it for where both are equally in fault, potior est conditio defendentis. There are, however, some exceptions or supposed exceptions to the rule of turpi causa. In Salmond and William on Contracts, four such exceptions have been mentioned, and the fourth of these exceptions is based on the right of restitutio in integrum, where the relationship of trustee and beneficiary is involved. Salmond stated the law in these words at p. 352 of his Book (2nd Edn.) So if A employs B to commit a robbery, A cannot sue B for the proceeds. And the position would be the same if A were to vest property in B upon trust to carry out some fraudulent scheme A could not sue B for an account of the profits. But if B, who is As agent or trustee, receives on As account money paid by C pursuant to an illegal contract between A and C the position is otherwise and A can recover the property from B, although he could not have claimed it from C. In such cases public policy requires that the rule of turpis causa shall be excluded by the more important and imperative rule that agents and trustees must faithfully perform the duties of their office. Williston in his Book on Contracts (revised edition), Vol. VI, has discussed this matter at p. 5069, para. 1785 and in paras. 1771 to 1774, he has noted certain exceptional cases, and has observed as follows If recovery is to be allowed by either partner or principal in any case, it must be where the illegality is of so light or venial a character that it is deemed more opposed to public policy to allow the defendant to violate his fiduciary relation with the plaintiff than to allow the plaintiff to gain the benefit of an illegal transaction. Even in India, certain exceptions to the rule of turpi causa have been accepted. Examples of those cases are found in Palaniyappa Chettiar v. Chockalingam Chettiar (1920) I.L.R. 44 Mad. 334 and Bhola Nath v. Mul Chand (1903) I.L.R. 25 All. 639. The respondents rely upon Farmers Mart Limited v. Milne 1915 A.C. 106, Alexander v. Rayson 1936 1 K.B. 169, and Berg v. Sadler Moore 1937 2 K.B. 158, to show that this case falls within the rule accepted and applied in those cases. The application of the rule is, however, conditioned by one thing, namely, that a plaintiff who is not allowed to succeed must be unable to sustain an action except upon the plea of the illegality committed by him. In Lord Dunedins speech in Farmers Mart Limited v. Milne 1915 A.C. 106, reference has been made to three cases, Simpson v. Bloss (1816) 7 Taunt. 246 129 E.R. 99, Fivaz v. Nicholls (1846) 2 C.B. 501 135 E.R. 1042 and Taylor v. Chester (1869) L.R. 4 Q.B. 309. In the first case, it was laid down that the test was whether a demand connected with an illegal transaction was capable of being enforced in law, and whether the plaintiff required any aid from the illegal transaction to establish his case. Tindal, C.J., in the second case observed as follows I think that this case may be determined on the short ground that the plaintiff is unable to establish his claim as stated upon the record, without relying upon the illegal agreement originally entered into between himself and the defendant. In the last case, Mellor, J., observed that the true test was by considering whether the plaintiff could make out his case otherwise than through the medium and by the aid of the illegal transaction to which he was himself a party. In Alexander v. Rayson 1936 1 K.B. 169, it was held by the Court of Appeal that there was a locus poenitentiae but that the repentance must be before the fraud or illegality had been carried out. Recently, the Court of Appeal in Bowmakers Ltd. v. Barnet Instruments, Ltd. 1945 1 K.B. 65, reviewed the law on the subject, and laid down that every illegality did not entitle the Court to refuse a judgment to a plaintiff. Du Parcq, L.J., observed as follows In our opinion, a mans right to possess his own chattels will as a general rule be enforced against one who, without any claim of right, is detaining them, or has converted them to his own use, even though it may appear either from the pleadings, or in the course of the trial, that the chattels in question came into the defendants possession by reason of an illegal contract between himself and the plaintiff, provided that the plaintiff does not seek, and is not forced, either to found his claim on the illegal contract or to plead its illegality in order to support his claim. We are aware that Prof. Hamson has criticised this case in (1949) 10 Cambridge Law Journal, 249, and has forborne its application, except in the clearest possible circumstances. The law has been also considered by Pritchard, J., in Bigos v. Bousted 1951 1 All. E.R. 92, where all the authorities are referred to. The correct position in law, in our opinion, is that what one has to see is whether the illegality goes so much to the root of the matter that the plaintiff cannot bring his action without relying upon the illegal transaction into which he had entered. If the illegality be trivial or venial, as stated by Williston and the plaintiff is not required to rest his case upon that illegality, then public policy demands that the defendant should not be allowed to take advantage of the position. A strict view, of course, must be taken of the plaintiffs conduct, and he should not be allowed to circumvent the illegality by resorting to some subterfuge or by mis-stating the facts. If, however, the matters is clear and the illegality is not required to be pleaded or proved as part of the cause of action and the plaintiff recanted before the illegal purpose was achieved, then, unless it be of such a gross nature as to outrage the conscience of the Court, the plea of the defendant should not prevail. We must remember that benami transactions are common in India, and have always been recognised. They are entered into for a variety of reasons, and the benamidar holds the property in trust for his principal. In the present case, the object of the benami transaction was merely to keep the property from being resumed by the Bettiah Raj on the expiry of the lease in favour of Radhumal, which undoubtedly the Bettiah Raj could have done, if it had been so minded. The information about the benami transaction was, however, not withheld from the Bettiah Raj, and even with that knowledge, the Bettiah Raj took no action against Radhumal or the benamidars. The plaintiffs recanted inasmuch as they asserted their true title and true facts before the occasion for the Raj to act arose. Thus, the fraud, though intended, was not perpetrated, because the fraud could only be effected at the end of the lease term, and the locus poenitentiae which the lessee possessed was duly used long before the expiry of the lease. The illegality was also of a trivial character, inasmuch as the signatures of Prahlad Rai and others were made on the relative documents on the faith of their close friendship and relationship and under the assumption that no objection from them would proceed to the making of the application on their behalf and to the signing of the B. H. forms in their names. The appellants were not required to prove this fact as part of their cause of action, and indeed, if the answering respondents are to be believed, they asserted as vehemently that the signatures were not forged but were their very own. In establishing the benami nature of a transaction, the cardinal point to be proved is the source of money and this was done, and it was also established that Prahlad Rai and others were merely farzidars. To prove these things, it did not require the proof of the signatures.DECISION ??"
106.0,Land Dispute,"Directed against the refusal by the High Court of Patna to require the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal to state a case and refer to it the question of law namely Whether under the facts and circumstances of the case, the amount of Rs. 1,30,785 being the excess of sale proceeds of the building, plant and machinery over the written down value of the business of the said newspapers publications could in law be termed to be income, profits and gains of the petitioner ? The facts which led to this appeal may be shortly stated. The appellant was the sole proprietor of the business which he carried on of publishing tow news-papers, namely The Indian National and Aryavart and which business had some assets. The Income-tax authorities had from time to time allowed to the appellant depreciation on the said assets for several years. In the accounting year 1356 Fasli corresponding to the assessment year 1950-1951, the appellant converted his said proprietary business into a private limited company. The entire capital of the newly-floated private limited company came out of the pocket of and was subscribed for by the appellant. The said newspapers publications and their assets were transferred from the sole proprietorship of the appellant to the newly floated private limited company of which the entire share capital was subscribed for and paid by the appellant. The appellant was allotted by way of consideration for the said transfer 25,000 shares of the said company out of which he held in his own name 24,950 share, the remaining 50 shares having been allotted at his instance to the names of his nominees by way of directors qualification shares. On the said transfer certain valuation was put on these assets. The written down value of the building as on the 30th September, 1948, was Rs. 29,669, the original cost thereof including the cost of subsequent additions being Rs. 49,270. The written down value of the machines and the plants as on the 30th September, 1948, was Rs. 1,19,368 as against the original cost thereof including subsequent additions which came to Rs. 2,30,552. There was thus a difference of Rs. 1,30,785 which represented the total amount of depreciation which had been allowed by the Income-tax authorities on these assets up to that date. When the valuation was put on these assets for the purpose of the transfer, the valuation of the building with subsequent additions showed an appreciation of Rs. 54,599 and the appreciation in regard to the machinery and plant together with subsequent additions came to Rs. 1,51,744. The appreciated value of these assets therefore aggregated to Rs. 2,06,343 which was in excess of the depreciation amount already allowed namely, Rs. 1,30,785. The Income-tax Officer while assessing the appellants income for the assessment year 1950-51 was of the opinion that the appellant had sold to the private limited company these assets at an appreciated value and realised profits thereby and since the difference between the original cost and the written down value, namely Rs. 1,30,785, was less than the appreciated sale price of Rs. 2,06,343, the entire amount of Rs. 1,30,785 was income, profits or gains in the hands of the appellant liable to be assessed during the relevant assessment year, and assessed the same accordingly. Appeals filed by the appellant before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal failed with the result that the appellant applied to the Tribunal to state a case inter alia in connection with this particular question and an application was made by him under section 66(1) of the Indian Income- tax asking that the aforesaid question be referred to the High Court for its opinion. The Tribunal refused to refer that question and the appellant thereupon made an application to the High Court under section 66(2) of the Act requesting the High Court to direct the Tribunal to state a case and refer the said question amongst others for its decision. The High Court as stated above declined to do so, and hence this appeal. Mr. Kolah appearing on behalf of the appellant has urged before us that the question whether the sum of Rs. 1,30,785 being the excess of the sale proceeds of the building, plant and machinery amounted to or could be deemed to be income, profits or gains of the appellant was a question of law and the High Court should have directed the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal to state a case and refer the said question to it for its decision. Reliance was placed by him on Doughty v. Commissioner of Taxes, Commissioner of Income-tax v. Sir Homi Mehtas Executors, and Kikabhai Premchand v. Commissioner of Income-tax and it was urged that the question whether there was a sale by the appellant to the newly floated private limited company which according to his submission was in no manner distinct and separate from the appellant himself and whether profits earned by the appellant in the matter of the said transaction of the transfer of the assets from himself as the proprietor to the newly floated private limited company as the transferee could be profits or gains in the real and commercial sense of the term was really a question of law and if regard be had to the observations of this court in the majority judgment in Kikabhai Premchand v. Commissioner of Income-tax that it was open to the court to lift the veil of corporate entity and look behind the same in order to see who were the real parties to the transaction, the present case would really come within the dictum that no man can make profit from himself. We are at present not concerned to express any opinion on the merits of this contention. Suffice it to say that this contention raises a question of law which should have been referred to the High Court by the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal for its decision, and when on the refusal of the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal to state a case and to refer the said question to the High Court the appellant approached the High Court, the High Court should, in the exercise of its jurisdiction under section 66(2) of the Income-tax Act, have asked the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal to state a case and refer the said question to it for its decision. The question as it has been framed is not aptly worded.DECISION ??"
107.0,Land Dispute,"The assessee, Her Highness Maharani Kesarkunverba Saheb, the Raj Mata of Morvi State, is the appellant and the Commissioner of Income-tax, Bombay North, is the respondent. The question that arises for decision is whether the annual cash allowance paid to the appellant in circumstances stated below falls within paragraph 15(1)(i) of the Part B States (Taxation Concessions) Order, 1950 (hereinafter referred to as the Order) and is therefore exempt from income-tax. The appellant was receiving from the Morvi State since 1922 an allowance called Jiwai (maintenance allowance). By a resolution dated September 26, 1946, passed by His Highness Lukhdhirji of Morvi, the husband of the appellant, it was resolved that a sum of Rs. 5,000 per month be paid to the appellant and provision be made for the amount by the Treasury Office in the Budget in the same manner as before. On January 21, 1947, His Highness Lukhdhirji abdicated and his son His Highness Mahendra Sinhji succeeded to the rulership. The covenant for the formation of the Kathiawar States Union was signed on January 23, 1948. On February 26, 1948, a resolution was passed by the son of the appellant granting a village, Mota Dahisara, to the appellant. The relevant portion of this resolution was as follows  From ancient times there has been a tradition in our family to grant a village to the Maharani for her enjoyment in order to maintain her status and dignity. However, since a village remains to be granted accordingly to our revered mother, Akhand-Sau-Bhagyawana Kesar Kunverba Sahib as the Maharani, it is resolved to grant her the village of Mota Dahisara, under (our) control and having the area and boundaries as per annexures hereto. We resolve to grant the said village, for enjoyment to out Maharani, Shri Vijaykunver of Rangpur, after the lifetime of our mother Kesar Kunverba Sahib in accordance with the above tradition. A formal grant was made on March 16, 1948, which was as follows In order to preserve permanently your status and dignity the village of Mouje Mota Dahisarais hereby granted to you as a gift in pursuance of the immemorial tradition of this State The said village and the land etc., thereof have been granted to you in order to maintain your status and dignity as the Queen Mother as stated above. You may enjoy the same in peace exclusively. On your death the right of enjoyment of the entire right, together with the restrictions mentioned in the present writing, shall vest in our Akhan Saubhagvanta Maharani Shri Vijay Kunvar of Rangpur. On March 20, 1948, the State of Morvi became a part of the Saurashtra Union. The Government of Saurashtra refused to continue the maintenance allowance or to recognise the grant of the village Mota Dahisara to the appellant. She then made certain representations and after some conferences and some discussion a copy of the order of the Political Department was sent to the appellant in which it was stated that the village would be resumed and an amount calculated on the basis of average revenue of the village for 3 years would be paid to her as cash allowance for lifetime. To this the appellant took objection and her son the Maharaja of Morvi also wrote a letter to the Rajpramukh of Saurashtra stating that the village had been illegally resumed and that her Jiwai had also been stopped. To this the Rajpramukh replied on May 19, 1949, saying that it had been decided that the village would be resumed and a cash allowance in lieu thereof would be paid to the appellant for life and he advised the Maharaja of Morvi not to press the claim as put forward in his letter and also that the appellant should accept the resumption of the village and agree to take a cash allowance instead. The appellant then wrote a letter to the Rajpramukh on May 26, 1949, in which she insisted that she should continue to have the village. On November 19, 1949, the appellants husband wrote to the Regional Commissioner, Mr. Buch, stating that he and her son, the Ruler, had with difficulty persuaded the appellant to accept Rs. 5,000 a month and not to insist on anything more. The following extract from the letter is rather important and is therefore quoted Most ladies are sentimental and she is no exception, and says her Abru would go if she loses her village, so we suggested that if she gets the income of the village, whatever it may be and any amount over and above that will be given to her as Jiwai, making a total of Rs. 60,000 a year with this she can say she got both the things and her prestige will not suffer. On March 30, 1950, the Government of Saurashtra passed a resolution that in pursuance of the decision taken at the Jamnagar Conference the grant of the village Mota Dahisara would be resumed and in lieu thereof a cash annuity of Rs. 35,807 would be paid. The appellant was also granted Jiwai as Rajmata of Rs. 24,193 per annum and thus a sum of Rs. 60,000 per annum, i.e., Rs. 5,000 per mensum, was continued to be paid to the appellant. On June 19, 1950, the grant of the village was liable to income-tax because in his view the appellant received that sum in exchange for two assets - right to the old maintenance allowance and the right to enjoy income from the village during her lifetime. On appeal to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner the amount of Rs. 35,807 was held to be liable to tax and not the sum of Rs. 24,193. An appeal was then taken to the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal which held that the entire sum was exempt from income-tax and super-tax, as it fell within paragraph 15(1)(i) of the Order. The Tribunal said In the circumstances of the case stated above, it appears to us that the sum of Rs. 60,000 is exempt from income-tax and super-tax. If you look at the substance of the transaction, it means that the assessee was granted a maintenance allowance of Rs. 60,000. The assessee wanted somehow or other to be associated with the village Mota Dahisara. To her it was a question of prestige. Again the cash annuity of Rs. 35,807 was given to the assessee in lieu of the village Mota Dahisara. The village was granted to her for the purpose of maintaining the assessees status and reputation as the Raj Mata. In other words, the village was given to her for her maintenance. At the instance of the respondent following question was referred under section 6(1) of the Income-tax Act to the High Court Whether there was material for the Tribunal to hold that the sum of Rs. 35,807 granted to the assessee was a maintenance allowance exempt within the meaning of paragraph 15(1)(i) of the Part B States (Taxation Concessions) Order, 1950 ? which was framed by the High Court as follows Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case the sum of Rs. 35,807 granted to the assessee was a maintenance allowance exempt within the meaning of paragraph 15(1)(i) of the Part B States (Taxation Concessions) Order, 1950 ? The High Court held that Rs. 35,807 and Rs. 24,193 were two distinct heads of cash annuities, the former in lieu of village Mota Dahisara and the latter by way of Jiwai, i.e., maintenance. It was of the opinion that the appellant was granted Jiwai (maintenance) of Rs. 5,000 per month by her husband as from September, 1947. It also held that the grant of the village was not by way of maintenance. After taking into consideration the several documents, that is, the grant, the letter of the appellants son dated March 23, 1949, to the Rajpramukh of Saurashtra, the letter dated November 19, 1949, of the appellants husband to Mr. Buch and the resolution of the Government dated March 30, 1950, the High Court held that under the resolution of the Saurashtra Government the appellant was given a cash annuity of Rs. 35,807 in lieu of the village and not by way of maintenance. Against this judgment, the appellant has come to this court in appeal by special leave. The controversy between the parties is confined to the nature of the grant of the village made to the appellant. The appellant contended that the grant of the village was as much maintenance as was the cash allowance which had been made to her before, and therefore it fell within the exemption under paragraph 15(1)(i) of the Order which is as follows  Any income falling within the following classes shall be exempt from income-tax and super-tax and shall not be included in the total income or total world income of the person receiving them  any sum which the widow or the mother of a person who was the Ruler of an Indian State receives as her maintenance allowance out of public revenue. The respondent on the other hand submitted that the words of the resolution dated February 26, 1949, and of the grant and particularly the following recitals therein From ancient times there has been a tradition in our family to grant a village to the Maha Rani for her enjoyment in order to maintain her status and dignity showed that the grant of the village was not by way of maintenance but merely to maintain a tradition of the family for keeping up the status and dignity of the appellant, and this, it was submitted, was fortified by the letter of the appellants husband dated November 19, 1949, where His Highness stated that the appellants Abru (prestige) would go if she were to lose the village. Reference in this connection was also made to the appellants letter dated May 26, 1949, wherein she insisted that the village should not be taken away from her as this would be unreasonable, arbitrary and contrary to the spirit of the covenant. In our opinion the connection of the appellant is well founded. The Tribunal has found after going into all the documents including the document containing the words to maintain her status and dignity and the letter of the appellants husband to Mr. Buch which mentioned the word Abru that the grant of the village was by way of maintenance and merely because the appellants relations wanted a face-saving device by splitting up the total amount payable per year it would not change the nature of the transaction nor would it change the grant of maintenance made to the appellant into something else. The grant of the village was as much by way of maintenance as was the cash allowance called Jiwai. Maintenance must vary according to the position and status of a person. It does not only mean food and raiment. The appellant was the wife of a ruling prince and at the time the grant of the village was made, she was the Raj Mata and therefore neither the use of the words status and dignity nor the reference to ancient usage could in any way change the nature of the grant. It is true that the appellant was anxious to retain the village because that gave her the satisfaction of having agricultural land which would be a tangible asset providing her a sure source of income but, merely because she wanted the village and in the resolution of March 30, 1950, mention is made of a sum an lieu of income from the village, the nature of the grant which in this case was by way of maintenance would not change. The question which was referred to the High Court was whether there was material to hold that the sum of Rs. 35,807 was maintenance allowance, but the High Court reformulated this question and after going into various documents it came to a conclusion different from that of the Tribunal and it reversed the findings of the Tribunal and answered the question in a manner suggestive of an appellate rather than advisory jurisdiction.

108.0,Land Dispute,"These appeals are directed against three judgments and orders of the Punjab High Court in three Civil Revisions Nos. 166-D, 167-D and 168-D which were brought by the appellants against three of their tenants under s. 35 of the Delhi Ajmer Rent Control Act (XXXVIII of 1952), hereinafter termed the Act. The appellants in all the three appeals are the landlords and the respondents in the three appeals are three different tenants. The appellants filed three separate suits for the eviction of their three tenants under cl. (g) of proviso to s. 13(1) of the Act on the ground that the premises were bona fide required for purposes of rebuilding. On February 27, 1953, the parties in all the three suits entered into a compromise in the following terms We have compromised the case with the plaintiff. A decree may be passed for Rs. 82/8/- on account of rent in suit and for ejectment in respect of the shop in suit in favour of the plaintiff against the defendants The defendants will vacate the shop by 4-3-53 and hand over possession to the plaintiff and the plaintiff will hand over its possession again (second time) to the defendants within six months from 4-3-53 after constructing it afresh. We shall pay such rent as this court will fix . Thereupon the court passed the following order and a decree followed thereon- In terms of the statements of the plaintiff., defendant and counsel for defendants a decree for Rs. 82/8/- on account of rent in suit be passed in favour of the plaintiff against the defendants. Also decree for ejectment be passed in respect of the shop in suit in favour of the plaintiff against the defendants and that the defendants do give possession of the shop in suit by 4-3-53 to the plaintiff and that the plaintiff after constructing it afresh within six months from 4-3-53 give it to the defendants. From out of the money deposited, a sum of Rs. 82/8/- be paid to the plaintiff and the balance returned to the defendants. The defendants shall be responsible to pay the rent fixed by the court . According to the decree the possession was to be given to the appellants on March 4, 1953, but it was actually delivered by the three respondents between March 7 and 15, 1953. On the completion of the building the three respondents filed three separate applications under s. 15 of the Act for their being put into possession. These applications were filed on October 7, 1953. The High Court held that the compromise did not comprise any matter which was not the subject matter of the suit that the respondents could enforce the terms of the decree in the proceedings which they took, i. e., under s. 15 of the Act that time was not of the essence of the compromise and therefore of the decree and consequently in spite of the possession of the premises having been given by the respondents after the date specified in the decree, i. e., March 4, 1953, the respondents were entitled to enforce the decree by execution and apply for possession being restored to them at any rate they could apply for restitution under the inherent powers of the Court. Thus the High Court was of the opinion that though s. 15(2) of the Act was not applicable to the proceedings they could be treated as Execution proceedings. Against this judgment and order the appellants have come in appeal to this court by special leave. Under s. 13 of the Act the respondents are protected against eviction excepting for the reasons given in the proviso. The appellants had filed the original suits for eviction under s. 13, proviso (g), which was as under Section 13- Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any other law or any contract, no decree or order for the recovery of possession of any premises shall be passed by any court in favour of the landlord against any tenant including a tenant whose tenancy is terminated) Provided that nothing in this sub-section shall apply to any suit or other proceeding for such recovery of possession if the Court is satisfied- (g) that the premises are bona fide required by the landlord for the purpose of rebuilding the premises or for the replacement of the premises by any building or for the erection of other building and that such building or rebuilding cannot be carried out without the premises being vacated . Thus when the suits were brought the provisions of the Act were invoked. The decrees passed were on the basis that the premises were required by the landlord for rebuilding which falls under s. 13 and the decrees also incorporated the requirements of s. 15 which provides- The Court shall, when passing any decree or order on the grounds specified in clause (f) or clause (g) of the proviso to sub. section (1) of section 13 ascertain from the tenant whether he elects to be placed in occupation of the premises or part thereof from which he is to be evicted and if, the tenant so elects, shall record the fact of the election in the decree or order and specify therein the date on or before which he shall deliver possession so as to enable the landlord to commence the work of repairs or building or rebuilding, as the case may be. If the tenant delivers possession on or before the date specified in the decree or order, the landlord shall, on the completion of the work of repairs or building or rebuilding place the tenant in occupation of the premises or part thereof. If, after the tenant has delivered possession on or before the date specified in the decree or order the landlord fails to commence the work of repairs or building or rebuilding within one month of the specified date or fails to complete the work in a reasonable time or having completed the work, fails to place the tenant in occupation of the premises in accordance with sub-section (2), the Court may, on the application of the tenant made within one year from the specified date, order the landlord to place the tenant in occupation of the premises or part thereof on the original terms and conditions or to pay to such tenant such compensation as may be fixed by the Court. The compromise, the order and the decree provided (1) that the respondents will vacate their respective shops on March 4, 1953, and hand over possession to the appellants (2) they elected to get back possession after rebuilding,which the appellants agreed to hand back on September 4, 1953 (3) the rent after such possession was to be determined by the court. It was contended on behalf of the appellants that the above facts taken with the circumstances that the decree was passed in a suit under s. 13(1), proviso (g), show that this was an order passed and a decree made in accordance with the terms of s. 15 of the Act. It is significant that the respondents themselves made the applications to the court under s. 15 of the Act. For the respondents it was argued that the decree was not one under s. 15 of the Act because the decree was based on a compromise whereby the parties fixed the date of delivery of possession to the appellants fixed the date for completion of the rebuilding and agreed between themselves as to repossession by the respondents. It was submitted that although the time for giving delivery to the appellants was fixed in the compromise it was not of the essence of the contract. In our opinion the contentions raised by the appellants are well founded and the appellants must succeed. The suits for eviction were brought within the framework of the Act and were based on the provisions of s. 13, proviso (g). No eviction would have been possible excepting when conditions laid down in s. 13 were satisfied. The decrees which were passed were substantially in accordance with the provisions of s. 15 of the Act and as was contended by the appellants they were decrees under which the premises had to be vacated by the respondents on a specified day. Under that section they had the right to elect and did elect to get possession after rebuilding this possession was to be given by the landlords to the tenants within a reasonable time and six months period was fixed by Consent between the parties and the rent, if the respondents were not put into possession on the same terms as before, was to be settled by court and that is what was done under the terms of the consent decree. The applications for being put into possession which were filed by the respondents were really under s. 15(3) of the Act. As the respondents did not deli- ver possession to the appellants on or before the dates specified in the decree the provisions of s. 15 contained in sub-s. (3) of that Act were not available to them and they were ,not entitled to be put into possession as prayed by them. It was argued that the appellants had taken possession of the premises after the specified date without protest and had even accepted rent upto then and were therefore estopped from raising that defence.DECISION ??"
109.0,Land Dispute,"The appellant is a Sugar Mill in District Saran in the State of Bihar. One Ramkrishna Prasad was appointed as clerk in this mill in 1933. Gradually, he worked his way up and was drawing Rs. 140 per month in October 1952. The mill created a new post of store in-charge about that time as the work in the Stores Department of the Mill had increased. On October 4, 1952, Babulal Parekh was appointed to this new post on a consolidated salary of Rs. 180 per menses. A letter of appointment was issued to him on that date and he was told that he would be on probation for one year. He was also asked by another letter to take charge immediately. He took charge on October 7, 1952. On November 28, 1952, an order was passed by the mill distributing the duties between the various clerks employed in the Stores Department and it was stated therein that all the staff of the Stores Department would work as subordinate to Babulal Parekh. On December 2, 1952, another order was passed by which Ramkrishna Prasad was ordered to hand over the keys of the stores to Babulal Parekh. Thereafter Ramkrishna Prasad made a representation against his being made subordinate to the stores in-charge. This representation was rejected. A dispute was then raised by the union and a reference was made by the Government of Bihar on May 9, 1956, in which the following three matters were referred to the tribunal-  Whether the status of workman, Sri Ramkrishna Prasad, Store-keeper, and the nature of the job performed by him has been changed to his prejudice with the appointment of a separate store in charge  Whether in view of the satisfactory performance of duties of store-keeper for the last 20 years by the above- named workman, it was at all necessary to appoint a separate store in-charge over him with higher emoluments and whether Shri Ramkrishna Prasad is entitled to be appointed to the post of store in-charge and  Whether the claim of the above-named workman for promotion to higher grades has been overlooked by the management, and if so, what relief the workman is entitled to. When the matter came up before the tribunal, the main contention on behalf of the mill was that it was exclusively the management function to decide its labour strength, both qualitatively and quantitatively, and that so far as Ramkrishna Prasad was concerned his position had not been prejudicially affected by the creation of the new post of a store in-charge. The workmen on the other hand contended that Babulal Parekh was first appointed as a mere clerk under Ramkrishna Prasad to begin with and it was only on November 28, 1952, that he was promoted over the head of Ramkrishna Prasad as a store in-charge, thus superseding Ramkrishna Prasad. This stand of the workmen was controverted by the mill and its case was that Babulal Parekh was from the very beginning appointed as store in- charge. The tribunal came to the conclusion after a consideration of the evidence produced that Babulal was first appointed as an ordinary clerk in the Stores Department and was subsequently made a store incharge. It held that this caused reasonable heart burning to Ramkrishna Prasad. The tribunal was conscious of the principle that promotion to a higher post was the exclusive function of the management and should not ordinarily be interfered with. But in spite of that it was of the view that this was a fit case for interference but on other considerations which were not specified in the order by the tribunal it held that it would not interfere with the arrangement made by the mill it instead granted an increment of Rs. 30 per month from the date of its order to Ramkrishna Prasad to meet the ends of justice. It is this order which is being challenged before us. Two points have been urged before us on behalf of the appellant. In the first place it is urged that the reference was incompetent as sugar was a controlled industry and only the Central Government could have made the reference and not the State Government. Secondly, it is urged that the order of the tribunal granting an increment of Rs. 30 per month to Ramkrishna Prasad was patently perverse and that there was no change in the status or emoluments of Ramkrishna Prasad by the creation of the new post and the employment of Babulal Parekh on it. So far as the question of the competence of the reference is concerned, we are of opinion that there is no force in it, A similar question was raised before this Court in The Bijoy Cotton Mills Ltd. v. Their Workmen and Another (1) and it was held there on the language of s. 2(a)(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, that before that provision could apply to a controlled industry there must be a notification by the Central Government for the purposes of s. 2(a)(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act. Section 2(a)(1) is in these terms- I Appropriate Government means in relation to any industrial dispute concerning any industry carried on by or under the authority of the Central Government or by a railway company or concerning any such controlled industry as maybe specified in this behalf by the Central Government, or in relation to an industrial dispute concerning a banking or an insurance company, a mine, an oil-field or a, major port, the Central Government. The argument is that as sugar is a controlled industry under the Schedule to the Industries (Development and Regulation) Act, No. 65 of 1951, the appropriate (1) 1960 2 S.C.R- 982, Government for the purposes of s. 2(a)(1) with reference to the sugar Industry is the Central Government. Reliance is placed on the words concerning any such controlled industry as may be specified in this behalf by the Central Government appearing in s. 2 (a)(1). It is true that sugar is a controlled industry under the Industries (Development and Regulation) Act, 1951, but that in our opinion does not conclude the matter. In order that the appropriate government under s. 2(a)(1) may be the Central Government for a controlled industry, it is necessary that such controlled industry should be specified by the Central Government for the purposes of s. 2(a)(1). This in our opinion is obvious from the words controlled industry as may be specified in this behalf by the Central Government appearing in s. 2(a)(1). It is not enough that an industry should be a controlled industry to attract this provision of s. 2(a)(1) it is further necessary that it should be specified in this behalf, namely for the purposes of s. 2(a)(1), as a controlled industry by the Central Government, before the Central Government can become the appropriate government within the meaning of s. 2(a)(1). We may in this connection refer to Firebricks and Potteries Ltd., etc. v. Firebricks and Potteries Ltd. Workers Union Ltd. (1) where the same view has been taken. We are of opinion that is the correct meaning of these words appearing in s. 2(a)(1), as already held in The Bijoy Cotton Mills Ltd. (2) . The objection that the reference was not competent therefore fails. We next come to the contention raised on behalf of the mill that there was in fact no prejudice whatsoever so far as the status and emoluments of Ramkrishna Prasad were concerned by the creation of the new post and the appointment of Babulal Parekh on it, and that the tribunal was not justified in any case in granting an increment of Rs. 30 per menses to Ramkrishna Prasad. The main consideration which influenced the tribunal in passing the order which it did was that in the view of the tribunal Ramkrishna Prasad was superseded by Babulal Parekh who was first appointed as a clerk under him. This view of I.L.R. 1955 MYS. 546. (2) 1960 2 S.C.R. 982. the tribunal in our opinion is patently erroneous. The appointment order dated October 4, 1952, clearly shows that Babulal Parekh was appointed as store inches from the very beginning at Rs. 180 per month. The tribunal referred to certain entries in the attendance register to hold that Babulal Parekh worked as clerk to begin with. It appears from the attendance register for the months of October, November and December that Babulal Parekh was marked present from October 7 to November 9. Thereafter from November 11 to the end of December he signed the attendance register. The statement of Cbaudhari, Labour Welfare Officer of the mill was that the practice in the mill was that officers used to be marked present in the attendance register while clerks used to sign it themselves. The tribunal has concluded from the fact that Babulal. Parekh signed the register in November that he must have been a clerk to begin with. The tribunal, however, completely overlooked that from October 7 to November 9, Babulal Parekh was marked present which would show that he was not a clerk. The tribunal also overlooked that even from November 28 to the end of December when Babulal Parekh admittedly was not a clerk but store in- charge he still signed the register, though he should have been marked present. Chaudhari was unable to explain how this happened, but he was hardly the person to explain this. It is, however, clear from this confusion that no importance can be attached to whether Babulal Parekh was marked present in the register or signed it. The real thing which determined the status of Babulal Parekh was the appointment order dated October 4, 1952, which the tribunal has accepted as correct. A question was certainly put to Chaudhari at the end of his cross-examination that he had manufactured the statements put in by him only the night before but he denied it. We cannot accept the suggestion on behalf of the respondents that the appointment order was ante-dated, for no such suggestion was made to Chaudhari and the tribunal itself does not find so. It is clear therefore that the finding of the tribunal that Babulal Parekh was appointed as clerk under Ramkrishna Prasad to begin with is patently perverse and it must be held that Babulal Parekh was from the very beginning working as store in-charge. Now in so far as Ramkrishna Prasad was concerned his work and emoluments remained the same after the appointment of Babulal Parekh. If a higher post was created in the Stores Department because of the increase in work, Ramkrishna Prasad could not claim promotion to it merely because he was working as a store-keeper before.DECISION ??"

We are of opinion that is the correct meaning of these words appearing in s. 2(a)(1), as already held in The Bijoy Cotton Mills Ltd. (2) . The objection that the reference was not competent therefore fails.

111.0,Land Dispute,"The appellant is the U. P. Electric Supply Co. Ltd., Lucknow, (hereinafter called the company). It appears that the company used to employ Messrs. s M. Choudhary (hereinafter referred to as the contractors) as its contractors for doing certain work for it. The contractors in their turn used to employ a number of persons to carry out the work which they had taken on contract. A dispute arose between the contractors and their workmen in 1956 and an application was made on June 6, 1956, by the workmen before the conciliation board. To this application both the company as well as the contractors were parties and four matters were referred by the workmen to the conciliation board, namely, (i) non-grant of bonus for the years 1953-54 and 1954-55 (ii) nongrant of festival holidays (iii) non-fixation of minimum wages of these workmen at par with the workmen employed by the company and (iv) nonabolition of the contract system. Efforts at conciliation failed and thereupon the Government of Uttar Pradesh made a reference to the Industrial Tribunal under the U. P. Industrial Disputes Act, No. XXVIII of 1947, (hereinafter called the Act). In this reference only three points were referred out of the four which were before the conciliation board, namely, those relating to bonus, festival holidays and payment of wages to these workmen at par with the workmen of the company. The fourth point which was raised before the conciliation board (namely, non-abolition of the contract system) was not referred. The parties to this reference were two, namely-(i) the contractors and (ii) their workmen. The appellant was not a party to this reference. On August 13, 1956, another notification was issued by the U. P. Government under ss. 3, 5 and 8 of the Act by which the company was impleaded as a party to the dispute referred by the notification of July 31, 1956. It is remarkable, however, that the matters of dispute which were specified in the reference dated July 31, 1956, were not amended as they could have been under the proviso to s. 4 of the Act, by adding the fourth point of dispute before the conciliation board, namely, the non-abolition of the contract system. When the matter came up before the industrial court it framed a number of issues and the first and most important issue ran thus Are the workmen concerned employees of the P. Electric Supply Co. Ltd., Lucknow or of Messrs. S. M. Chaudhary, contractors ? The main objection of the company was that the dispute, if any was between the contractors and their employees and that there was no dispute between the company and its workmen. It was further objected that there was no valid or legal order of the Government referring any dispute between the company and its workmen to the tribunal and therefore the tribunal had no jurisdiction. On the merits it was urged that the workmen concerned were not the workmen of the company and there was no relationship of employer and employee between the company and these workmen and therefore the company could not be regarded as a party to the dispute between the contractors and their workmen. It is therefore clear that the main question which was considered by the tribunal was whether the workmen concerned were the workmen of the company or of the contractors. As the tribunal itself says, the crux of the whole case was whether the workmen concerned were the employees of the company . The tribunal went into the evidence in this connection and came to the conclusion that these workmen were in fact and in reality the employees of the company. The main contention on behalf of the company before us is that even assuming that the Government had power under s. 5 read with cl. 12 of G. O. No. U-464 (LL)XXXVI-B- 257(LL)/1954, dated July 14, 1954, to implied the company as a party, the main issue decided by the tribunal was not referred to it and the tribunal could only decide the three matters of dispute included in the order of reference of July 31, 1956. Therefore, in so far as the tribunal went beyond the, three matters of dispute specified in the reference and decided the question whether the workmen concerned were in the employ of the company or of the contractors it was acting without jurisdiction as this matter was never referred to it. We are of opinion that this contention must prevail. As we have already pointed out, there were four matters before the conciliation board including the question of non-abolition of the contract system. Further before the conciliation board not only the contractors but the company was also a party, for obviously the question of non-abolition of the contract system would necessitate the presence of the company as a party to the proceedings. When however the Government referred the dispute to the tribunal on July 31, it did not include the fourth item which was before the conciliation board relating to the non-abolition of the contract system among the matters in dispute. It also did not include the company as one of the parties to the dispute, for the reference-order refers only to two parties to the dispute, namely, the contractors and their workmen. On such a reference there could be no jurisdiction in the tribunal to decide the question whether these workmen were the workmen of the company or of the contractors, for such a question was not referred to the tribunal. It is true that on August 13, 1956, the company was impleaded as a party to the dispute referred by the notification of July 31 but the matters in dispute remained unmended, and the question of non-abolition of the contract system or the question whether these workmen were the employees of the company in fact and in reality was not included in the matters of dispute by amendment under the proviso to s. 4 of the Act.DECISION ??"

In view of the impending partition, the plaintiff was anxious to transfer his moveable property outside the territory it was apprehended would be included in Pakistan, and he gave instructions for transferring his accounts with the Bank to its other branches in India. He also paid an amount of Rs. 1,25,000/- on July 18, 1947, into the Bank at Lahore with instructions to transmit the same the to Bank branch at Calcutta which it then proposed to open in the near future. An amount of Rs. 10,000/- was also paid into the Bank at Lahore on July 19, 1947, with similar instructions. In respect of these two transactions the Bank executed receipts which are set out below Received the sum of Rs. 1,25,000/- (Rs. One Lac twenty five thousand) only from Mr. Pearey Lal on account of amount to be remitted to Calcutta branch for preparing various F.D.

Receipts at his instance when he calls upon them personally on or after the opening date of the Branch. Lahore for the New Bank of India Ltd. 19-7-47. Sd. Illegible Manager. The two amounts were transmitted by the Bank to Calcutta. A branch of the Bank was opened at Calcutta on September 24, 1947, but within a few days thereafter the Bank ceased making payments. It appears that a moratorium for a limited period was declared under an Ordinance issued by the Governer-General restraining the Bank from making payments to its depositors.In December, 1947, after the expiry of the period of the moratorium the plaintiff applied to the Banks branch at Calcutta for facility to withdraw the whole amount but the Calcutta Branch raised certain technical objections against such a course. On March 24, 1948 the plaintiff commenced an action against the Bank inter alia for a decree of Rs. 1,35,000/- in the Calcutta High Court on its original side. During the pendency of the suit the High Court of East Punjab sanctioned a scheme for arrangement under ss. 153 and 153A of the Indian Companies Act, 1913, for settlement of the liability of the Bank. By the first clause of the scheme the expression deposit was to include Fixed Deposits, Banks own Cash Certificates, Current Accounts, Deposits at Call, Savings Fund Accounts Amounts lying in Sundries or in any other kind of Credit Accounts, Bank Drafts, Cash Orders, and documents of the like nature and amounts due to Bankers over and above the value of Government Securities lying with them against such depositors. It was directed by the scheme, as it finally emerged, that the depositors were to be paid 701/2 of the deposits held by them and to he allotted shares of the face value of 5 of the deposits. The plaintiff claimed by his suit that he had entrusted to the Bank at its registered office at Lahore Rs. 1,35,000/- on July 18 and 19, 1947, with instructions to transmit the same to the branch of the Bank which it proposed to open at Calcutta and to hold the amount subject to further instructions to be given by him when he would call personally at the branch at Calcutta on or after the opening date, that prior to the opening of the said Calcutta Branch the plaintiff countermanded his instructions on or about September 13, 1947 and demanded at Lahore that it be returned, but the Bank wrongfully claimed to have remitted the two sums to its Calcutta Branch and to have kept the same in a fixed deposit account in the name of the plaintiff, even though the plaintiff, had opened no such account at the Calcutta Branch and had given no instructions to put the same into any account by way of fixed deposit or otherwise. The plaintiff, accordingly, claimed that the Bank was a trustee for transmission of the amount and in the absence of any instructions given by him for opening a fixed deposit account, in respect of the amount transmitted the Bank stood qua the plaintiff in a fiduciary relation and was liable to refund the full amount. In substance, it was claimed by the plaintiff that the amount lying with the Bank at Calcutta was not a deposit within the meaning of the scheme and was not liable to any reduction. The Bank submitted that the amount of Rs. 1,35,000/- was deposited by the plaintiff at its head office at Lahore for the purpose of opening a fixed deposit account in the name of the plaintiff upon the terms that the fixed deposit would carry interest as on the respective dates of the deposits, that it was agreed that the plaintiff would be allowed to take loans upto 90 of the deposit at a rate of interest of half percent above the current fixed deposit rates and that the amount would be transmitted to the Calcutta Branch of the Bank for the purpose of crediting the same to the fixed deposit account of the plaintiff. The Bank denied the alleged instructions in September, 1947, countermanding the original arrangement and contended that the plaintiff was bound by the scheme of arrangement sanctioned by the High Court of East Punjab.The Bank offered to pay the amount due to the plaintiff under the scheme of arrangement and also to allot shares of the value of 5 in accordance with the scheme. A decree on admission was passed against the Bank for Rs. 81,000/- and the suit was contested by the Bank for the balance of the claim. The trial Court held that even though the plaintiff failed to prove the instructions in the month of September, 1947, set up by him countermanding transmission, it was established on the evidence, that the plaintiff had entrusted to the Bank Rs. 1,35,000/- for transmission and the plaintiff having given no further instructions, the Bank held the amount as trustee for the plaintiff and that the plaintiffs claim was not liable to be reduced under the scheme sanctioned by the High Court of East Punjab. The Court also negatived the plea of the Bank that the amount of Rs. 1,35,000/- was deposited with the Bank at Lahore for opening a fixed deposit account subject to the conditions which the Bank set up. The finding of the trial Court were confirmed, in appeal, by a Division Bench of the High Court at Calcutta. The facts found proved, according to the findings of the trial Court and confirmed by the High Court are therefore that the plaintiff delivered an amount of Rs. 1,25,000/- on July 19, 1947, and Rs. 10,000/- on July 19, 1947, to the Bank at Lahore for transmission to Calcutta, with instructions to await the directions of the plaintiff regarding the opening of accounts for keeping the same in fixed deposit or otherwise in the Calcutta Branch of the Bank, and the plaintiff never gave instructions for opening any account, fixed deposit or otherwise, in regard to the amounts after they reached Calcutta. Delivery of the amount for transmission to the Bank created ex facie a relationship of a fiduciary character. But counsel for the Bank contends that when the amount was handed over at Lahore to the Bank by the plaintiff who was an old constituent of the Bank it must be presumed that a relationship of debtor and creditor arose and by the addition of instructions for transmissions of the amount to another branch the relationship of trustee and cestuique-trust did not arise. He submitted that the contention that the relation between the plaintiff and the Bank was of creditor and debtor was supported by three important circumstances (1) that the Bank agreed to pay interest on the amount delivered by the plaintiff (2) that the Bank charged no commission or remuneration for transmission of the amount and (3) that even on the plaintiffs case the amount was to be utilized for opening fixed deposit accounts at Calcutta. It is true that in the absence of other evidence a person paying money into a Bank, whether he is a constituent of the Bank or not, may be presumed to have paid the money to be held as bankers ordinarily hold the moneys of their constituents. If no specific instructions are given at the time of payment or thereafter, and even if the money is held in a suspense account the bank does not thereby become a trustee for the amount paid. In other words, when a person dealing with a bank delivers money to the Bank an intention to create a relation of creditor and debtor between him and the Bank is presumed, it being the normal course of the business of the Bank to accept deposits from its customers. But this presumption is one of fact arising from the nature of the business carried on by the Bank and is rebutted by proof of special instructions, or circumstances attending the transaction. Where the money is paid to a bank with special instructions to retain the same pending further instructions (The Official Assignee, Madras v. Natesam Pillai (1)) or to pay over the same to another person who has no banking account with the bank and the bank accepts the instructions and holds the money pending instructions from that other person (Arbuthnot Co. v. D. Rajam Ayyar (2)), or where instructions are given by a customer to his banker that a part of the amount lying in his account be forwarded to another bank to meet a bill to become due and payable by him and the amount is sent by the banker as directed (Farley v. Turner (3)), a trust results and the presumption which ordinarily arises by reason of payment of the money to the bank is rebutted. It is not necessary in this appeal to consider whether because of an agreement to pay interest the relationship may be deemed to be of debtor and creditor, because it was held by both the courts below that no such agreement is proved, and according to the settled practice of this court the finding is regarded a binding. The Bank charged no commission or remuneration for transmitting the amount to Calcutta, but that, in our judgment, is a circumstance which permits of no inference against the plaintiff. Undoubtedly, when the amount was delivered to the Bank by the plaintiff it was his intention to open fixed deposit account in Calcutta with the Banks branch but the fixed deposit accounts were to be opened after instructions were received. The transaction, as evidenced by the two receipts, was primarily one of entrustment of the amount to the Bank for transmission to Calcutta. After the purpose for which the moneys were entrusted was carried out, in the absence of further instructions the defendant did not cease to be a trustee. So long as instructions were not given by the plaintiff for appropriation of the amounts the Bank continued to hold the amounts transmitted for and on behalf of the plaintiff and there is no evidence that the plaintiff gave instructions or acquiesced in the opening of a fixed deposit account after the same reached Calcutta. It is immaterial that the Bank purported to open fixed deposit account in the name of the plaintiff with the amounts received at its head office at Lahore. That course of action was adopted without the consent of the plaintiff and it could not bind the plaintiff. The High Court was, therefore, right in holding that the amount delivered by the plaintiff to the Bank at Lahore remained in trust even after it reached Calcutta, and it was not held by the Bank, in deposit for the plaintiff within the meaning of the scheme sanctioned by the High Court of East Punjab.DECISION ??"
113.0,Land Dispute,"Das Gupta, J. This appeal by special leave is against the order of the High Court at Allahabad under s. 133 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The three appellants carry on the trade of auctioning vegetables. These vegetables, it appears, are brought in carts which are parked on the public road outside the building where the auctioning takes place. There was some dispute between these appellants and the Municipal Board which it is suggested by the appellants was really behind the move to get this order under s. 133 passed against them. It is unnecessary, however, for us to consider that matter. What appears to be clear is that the trade is carried on in a private house in the subzimandi quarter and it does happen that some amount of inconvenience is caused to people who pass by the public road because of the carts which necessarily come near this house. The real question is, whether because this trade of auctioning vegetables which the appellants carry on in their private house produce the consequence that people passing by the road are put to inconvenience, action can be taken under s. 133 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The High Court seems to be of the opinion - when it is clear that the business of auctioning vegetables cannot be carried on without causing obstruction to the passers by, the conduct of the business can be prohibited, even though it is carried on in a private place. It seems to us that this proposition has been put too widely. Section 133 of the Code of Criminal Procedure empowers action by the District Magistrate, Sub-Divisional Magistrate of Magistrate 1st class to remove public nuisances in certain circumstances. Two out of the several cls. of s. 133(1) in which these circumstances are set out, with which we are concerned, are the first and second clauses. The first clause provides for action by Magistrate where he considers, on receiving a police-report or other information and on taking such evidence as he thinks fit, that any unlawful obstruction or nuisance should be removed from any way, river or channel which is or may be lawfully used by the public or from any public place. The second clause deals with the position where the conduct of any trade or occupation or the keeping of any goods or merchandise, is injurious to the health or physical comfort of the community and that in consequence such trade or occupation should be prohibited or regulated or such goods or merchandise should be removed or the keeping thereof regulated. It is difficult to see how the first clause can have any application.Unlawful obstruction, if any, is certainly not caused by the people who carry on the trade of auctioning. If the obstruction caused by keeping the carts on the road can be considered to be unlawful obstruction within the meaning of this clause - about which we express no opinion action can be taken against the persons causing such obstruction. The obvious difficulty in the way of that might be that the persons who bring the carts are not the same from day do day. But whether or not any action is possible under s. 133 against the persons bringing the carts, we are unable to agree that merely because the appellants carry on auctioning in connection with which the carts are brought, they can be considered to have caused the obstruction. In our opinion, the appellants cannot be considered to be the persons causing obstruction. Turning now to the next clause, the question arises how the conduct of this auctioning trade is injurious to the health or physical comfort of the community. Undoubtedly, some amount of noise the auction is going on. That however is a necessary concomitant of buying and selling large quantities and it will be unreasonable to think that merely because some amount of noise is caused which people preferring perfect peace may not like, this is injurious to the physical comfort, or health of the community. It appears to us that the conduct of trades of this nature and indeed of other trades in localities of a city where such trades are usually carried on, is bound to produce some discomfort, though at the same time resulting perhaps in the good of the community in other respects. If a trade like auctioning which has to be carried on as necessary for the well being of the community, some amount of noise has to be borne in at least that part of the town where such trade is ordinarily carried on. In making the provisions of s. 133 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the legislature cannot have intended the stoppage of such trades in such part of the town, merely because of the discomfort caused by the noise in carrying on the trade. In our opinion therefore, the slight discomfort that may be caused to some people passing by the road or living in the neighbourhood cannot ordinarily be considered to be such as to justify action under s. 133 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. We do not think that the orders are justified under s. 133.DECISION ??"
114.0,Land Dispute,"Appeal by special leave from the judgment and decree dated December 1, 1955, of the Madras High Court in second Appeal No. 736 of 1953. Ganapathy Iyer, R. Thiagarajan and G. Gopalakrishnan, for the appellants. S. Prashar, A. S. Chaturvedi and K. R. Chaudhari, for the respondent. 1962. November 30. The judgment of the Court was delivered by MUDHOLKAR, J. -Only one question arises for consideration in this appeal by special leave and that is the meaning to be given to the expression final decision occurring in the first proviso to s. 28 A of the Provincial Insolvency Act, 1920 (Act No. 5 of 1920), introduced by Act No. 25 of 1948. For appreciating the argument advanced before us a few facts have to be stated. Venkata Reddy, the father of the appellants, was adjudicated an insolvent by the Sub-Court, Salem in I. P. No. 73 of 1935. At that time only the appellants 1 and 2 were born while the third appellant was born later. The fathers one-third share was put up for auction by the Official Receiver and was purchased by one Karuppan Pillai for Rs. 80/-. The Official Receiver then put up for auction the two-thirds share belonging to appellants 1 and 2 on July 27, 1936, which was purchased by the same person for Rs. 341/-. He sold the entire property to the respondent Pethi Reddy on May 25, 1939, for Rs. 300/-. The appellants instituted a suit on February 1, 1.943, for the partition of the joint family property to which suit they made Pethi Reddy a party and claimed thereunder two- thirds share in the property puchased by him. In that suit it was contended on behalf of the respondent that on their fathers insolvency the share of the appellants in the joint family property also vested in the Official Receiver and that he had the power to sell it. The contention was negatived by the trial court which passed a preliminary decree for partition in favour of the appellants. The decree was affirmed in appeal by the District judge and eventually by the High Court in second appeal, except with a slight variation regarding the amount of mesne profits. The decision of the High Court is dated November 18, 1946. On January 18, 1946 the appellants made an application for a final decree which was granted ex parte on August 17, 1946. At the instance of the present respondent this decree was set aside. By that time the new provision, that is, s. 28 A of the Provincial, Insolvency Act, had come into force. On the basis of this provision it was contended by the respondent that the appellants were not entitled to the allotment of their two-thirds share in the property purchased by him inasmuch as that share had also vested in the Official Receiver. The District Munsif held that Act 25 of 1948 which introduced s. 28 A did not affect the preliminary decree for partition since it had been passed on August 20, 1943. He, therefore, restored the ex parte final decree which had been set aside on December 17, 1950. The appeal preferred by the respondent against the decision of the District Munsif was dismissed by the Principal Subordinate judge, Salem, whereupon he preferred a second appeal before the High Court. The High Court allowed the appeal and dismissed the application of the appellant for passing the final decree, Section 28A of the Provincial Insolvency Act runs as follows The property of the insolvent shall comprise and shall always be deemed to have comprised also the capacity to exercise and to take proceedings for exercising all such powers in or over or in respect of property as might have been exercised by the insolvent for his own benefit at the commencement of his insolvency or before his discharge Provided that nothing in this section shall affect any sale, mortgage or other transfer of the property of the insolvent by a Court or Receiver or the Collector acting tinder s. 60 made before the commencement of the Provincial Insolvency (Amendment) Act, 1948, which has been the subject of a final decision by a competent Court Provided further that the property of the insolvent shall not be deemed by reason of anything contained in this section to comprise his capacity referred to in this section in respect of any such sale, mortgage or other transfer of property made in the State of Madras after the 28th day of July, 1942. and before the commencement of the Provincial Insolvency (Amendment) Act, 1948. The objects and reasons set out in the bill which sought to introduce this provision were to bring the provisions of the provincial insolvency Act in line with those of the Presidency Towns Insolvency Act in so far as the vesting of the joint family property in the Official Receiver upon the fathers insolvency was concerned. While under the Presidency Towns Insolvency Act, in a case of this kind, the disposing power of the father over the interest of his undivided sons also vests in the Official Receiver and not merely the fathers own interest in the joint family property there was divergence of opinion amongst the High Courts in India as to whether under the Provincial Insolvency Act the fathers disposing power over his undivided sons interest also vests in the Official Receiver. A Full Bench of the Madras High Court held in Ramasastrulu v. Balakrishna Rao (1) that it does not. It was in the light of this decision that in the appellants suit for partition, a preliminary decree was passed with respect to their two- thirds interest in the joint family property which had been sold by the Official Receiver. In the course of the decision of the Full Bench a suggestion was made that the legislature should step in and bring the provisions of the Provincial Insolvency Act in the relevant respect in line with those of the Presidency Towns Insolvency Act. The new provision makes it clear that the law is and has always been that upon the fathers insolvency his disposing power over the interest of his undivided sons in the joint family property vests in the Official Receiver and that consequently the latter has a right to sell that interest. The-provision is thus declaratory of the law and was intended to apply to all cases except those covered by the two provisos. We are concerned here only with the first proviso. This proviso excepts from the operation of the Act a transaction such as a sale by an Official Receiver which has been the subject of a final decision by a competent Court. The short question, therefore. is whether the preliminary decree for partition passed in this case which was affirmed finally in second  I.L.R. 1943 Mad. 83. appeal by the High Court of Madras can be regard as a final decision. The competence of the court is not in question here. What is, however, contended is that in a partition suit the only decision which can be said to be a final decision is the final decree passed in the case and that since final decree proceedings were still going on when the Amending Act came into force the first proviso was not available to the appellants. It is contended on behalf of the appellants that since the rights of the parties are adjudicated upon by the court before a preliminary decree is passed that decree must, in so far as rights adjudicated upon arc concerned, be deemed to be a final decision The word decision even in its popular sense means a concluded opinion (see Strouds Judicial Dictionary--3rd ed. Vol. 1, p. 743). Where, therefore, the decision is embodied in the judgment which is followed by a decree finality must naturally attach itself to it in the sense that it is no longer open to question by either party except in an appeal, review or revision petition as provided for by law. The High Court has, however, observed The mere declaration of the rights of the plaintiff by the preliminary decree, would, in our opinion not amount to a final decision for it is well known that even if a preliminary decree is passed either in a mortgage suit or in a partition suit, there are certain contingencies in which such a preliminary decree can be modified or amended and therefore would not become final. It is not clear from the judgment what the contingencies referred to by the High Court are in which a preliminary decree can be modified or amended unless what the learned judges meant was modified or amended in appeal or in review or in revision or in exceptional circumstances by resorting to the powers conferred by ss. 151 and 152 of the Code of Civil Procedure. If that is what the High Court meant then every decree passed by a Court including decrees passed in cases which do not contemplate making of a preliminary decree are liable to be modified and amended. Therefore, if the reason given by the High Court is accepted it would mean that no finality attaches to decree at all. That is not the law. A decision is said to be final when so far as, ,the Court rendering it is concerned, it is unalterable except by resort to such provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure as permit its reversal, modification or amendment. Similarly, a final decision would mean a decision which would operate as res judicate between the parties if it is not sought to be modified or reversed by preferring an appeal or a revision or a review application as is permitted by the Code. A preliminary decree passed, whether it is in a mort- gage suit or a partition suit, is not a tentative decree but must, in so far as the matters dealt with by it are concerned, be regarded as conclusive. No doubt, in suits which contemplate the making of two decrees--a preliminary decree and a final decree-the decree which would be executable would be the final decree But the finality of a decree or a decision does not necessarily depend upon its being executable. The legislature in its wisdom has thought that suits of certain types should be decided in stages and though the suit in such cases can be regarded as fully and completely decided only after a final decree is made the decision of the court arrived at the earlier stage also has a finality attached to it. It would be relevant to refer to s. 97 of the Code of Civil Procedure which provides that where a party aggrieved by a preliminary decree does not appeal from it, he is precluded from disputing its. correctness in any appeal which may be preferred from the final decree. This provision thus clearly indicates that as to the matters covered by it, a preliminary decree is regarded as embodying the final decision of the court pass- ing that decree. The High Court, however, thinks that a decision cannot be regarded as final if further proceedings are required to be taken for procuring the relief to which a party is held entitled by that decision. In support of its view the High Court has referred to the following observations in in re A Debtor(1) It is clear., therefore, that further proceedings will be necessary to get the money out of court and I think it is also clear that the order of October 24, in its own terms, did not finally determine. the right of the petitioner, or any one else, in respect of the sum to be paid. In my opinion, therefore, the order is not a final order In that case the Divorce Court made an order that the co- respondent do within seven days from the service of this order pay into Court the sum of pound 67 Is. 9d. being the amount of the petitioners costs, as taxed and certified by one of the registrars of this Division. The order was made in that form because at that time the ultimate fate of the petition was undecided. No doubt, the decree nisi had been passed but it had yet to be made absolute land the right of the petitioner to receive the costs might never have been brought to fruition. The money had therefore to be paid into the court. A little latter a further order was made by the President of the Divorce Court in these terms Upon hearing the solicitors for the petitioner I do order that the order herein dated the 11th day of July 1928 be varied and that (the debtor) the co-respondent do within seven days from the service of this order pay to Messrs H. L. Lumley Co., of 35 Picadilly W. 1, the solicitors of the petitioner, the sum of pound 67 Is. 9d. being the amount of the petitioners taxed costs as taxed and certified by one of the (1)1929 2 Ch, 146. registrars of this Division, the said solicitors undertaking to lodge in Court any sums recovered under this order. Pursuant to this order the solicitors gave an undertaking required by the Court to the registrar on October 26. On November 5, the decree nisi was made absolute. On January 2, 1929, a bankruptcy notice was issued by the solicitors against the debtor, for payment to them of the amount of pound 67 1 s. 9d. The co-respondent did not comply with the bankruptcy notice and accordingly on January 27, the solicitors presented a bankruptcy petition against him. Over-ruling the objection by the co-respondent, that is, the debtor that the bankruptcy notice was bad on, amongst other things, the ground that the second order made by the President of the Divorce Division was not a final order within sub-s. 1 (g) of s. 1 of the Bankruptcy Act, 1914, the registrar made a receiving order. In appeal it was contended that the receiving order was wrong because the solicitors were not the creditors of the debtor and also because the order for payment of the costs to them was not a final order. While upholding the latter contention Lord Hanworth, M. R., said what has been quoted above and relied upon by the High Court. Upon the particular facts of the case the order was clearly not a final order and in making the observations quoted above the Master of Rolls did not formulate a test for determining what could be regarded as a final order in every kind of case. The observations of the Master of Rolls must be read in the context of the facts of the case decided by him. Read that way those observations do not help the respondents. Apart from this, the short answer to the reason given by the High Court is that even a money decree passed in a suit would cease to be a final decision because if the judgment- debtor against whom the decree is pawed does not pay the amount voluntarily execution proceedings will have to be taken for re- covering the amount from him. It would thus lead to an absurdity if the test adopted by the High Court is accepted. In support of the High Courts view a few decisions were cited at the bar but as they are of no assistance we have not thought it fit to refer to them. We may, however, refer to a decision of this court upon which reliance was placed by the respondents. That is the decision in Vakalapudi Sri Ranga Rao and others V. Mutyala Ammanna (1) in which it was held that a particular order was not a final decision within the meaning of the first proviso to S. 28-A. There, in a suit for partition and another suit for possession of the suit property and arrears of rent, it was contended that upon the fathers insolvency the Official Receiver was in- competent to sell the sons interest in the joint family property. The contention was negatived by the trial court but upheld in appeals by the Subordinate judge who remanded the suits to the trial court with certain directions. Appeals preferred against his decision were dismissed by the High Court. Before the decision of the suits after remand, the Amending Act, XXV of 1948 came into force and it was contended before the trial court that in view of the new provision the sale by the Official Receiver must be held to be good even so far as the sons interest was concerned. This contention was negatived by the trial court on the ground that the decision of the High Court on the point was a final order within the meaning of the proviso. The District judge, before whom appeals were preferred, however, negatived the contention and held that there was no final order with regard to the sale by the Official Receiver. The High Court reversed the decision of the District judge but this Court held that the orders of remand made by the Subordinate Judge and upheld by the High Court were interlocutory orders as also were the orders of C.A. No. 634 of 1957, decided on March 29, 1961. the High Court in the appeals prefer-red before it and as such could be challenged in the appeal preferred before this Court against the decision of the High Court in the appeal against the final decree in the suit. In the case before us the preliminary decree was never challenged at all by preferring any appeal and therefore, the matters conclude by it are not open to challenge in an appeal against the final decree. Further, a preliminary decree cannot be equated with an interlocutory order within the meaning of s. 105, Code of Civil Procedure. It will thus be seen that the decision relied upon has no application to the facts of this case. Our conclusion, therefore, is that in this case the sale made by the Official Receiver during the insolvency of the appellants father was the subject of a final decision by a competent court inasmuch as that court decided that the sale was of no avail to the purchaser at the Official Receiver had no power to effect that sale. Nothing more was required to be established by the appellants before being entitled to the protection of the first proviso to s.28A. Since they have established what was required to be established by them, they are entitled to a final decree and the High Court was in error in dismissing their application in that behalf. In the result we allow the appeal, set aside the judgment and decree of the High Court and restore that of the trial court as affirmed in appeal by the learned Subordinate judge. Costs in this court and in the High Court will be borne by the present respondent.DECISION ??"
115.0,Land Dispute, Leave granted. The appellant A2 Azeez along with two others i.e. A1 Khalid and A3 Babu was tried by the Judicial Magistrate First Class I Aluva for offences punishable under Sections 457 and 380 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code for short the IPC . By order dated 15 12 2000 learned Magistrate convicted the appellant under Section 457 of the IPC and sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for one year. The appellant was further convicted for offence under Section 380 of the IPC and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for two years. The substantive sentences were ordered to run concurrently. A1 Khalid and A3 Babu were acquitted. The appellant challenged the said order before the Additional Sessions Judge Ernakulam. Learned Sessions Judge by his order dated 28 11 2002 confirmed the conviction and sentence and dismissed the appeal. Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence the appellant filed a criminal revision petition in the Kerala High Court. By the impugned judgment the High Court dismissed the revision petition. Hence this appeal by special leave is filed against the said judgment. According to the prosecution the appellant along with A1 Khalid and A3 Babu with an intention of committing theft entered the house of PW1 Radha at Karumalloor Village on 12 11 1995 at 4.00 a.m through the door which was kept open. They entered the bedroom where PW2 Renuka Devi was sleeping and committed theft of a gold chain weighing 14 grams worth Rs7 500 which PW2 was wearing while she was sleeping. A1 and A3 assisted the appellant in committing the offence. They gave the gold chain to the appellant for selling. The appellant sold the gold chain and the accused divided the sale proceeds and thereby committed the offence. This case presents rather unusual facts. PW7 the Circle Inspector stated that he arrested the accused on 28 11 1995 at 1 a.m near the parking area Municipal Buildings Aluva while they were moving in suspicious circumstances. On questioning them it was revealed that they had committed the offence involved in this case hence they proceeded to the house of PW1 at Aduvathuruthu and recorded her F.I.R Ext.P1 . PW1 in her evidence stated that her daughter PW2 was sleeping in her room on the night of 12 11 1995. PW2 was wearing Thara fashion gold chain. The gold chain was stolen but no complaint was lodged at the police station because PW2 did not realize that her gold chain was stolen. It is only on 28 11 1995 when the police came to their house along with the accused and the gold chain was shown to her that she realized that the gold chain was stolen. She identified the gold chain MO1. FIR Ext.P1 was then lodged. PW2 the daughter stated that on 12 11 1995 at about 11 p.m. she went to sleep. On the next day morning the gold chain was not seen. On 28 11 1995 when the police came to her house with the accused and showed her the chain she realized that her chain was stolen. She identified the chain. Evidence of PWs 1 and 2 raise several question marks. If gold chain worn by PW2 was removed by the accused at night it is unbelievable that she would not realize it in the morning. Even PW1 the mother did not realize that the chain worn by PW2 was not around her neck. Assuming this to be true PWs 1 and 2 would at least realize the loss on the next day or a day thereafter. They did not realize that the chain was stolen till 28 11 1995 when the police came to their house with the accused and showed them the chain. At that time they realized that chain was stolen. It is on 28 11 1995 that PW1 lodged her complaint. Thus the complaint came to be lodged about sixteen days after the incident that too after the police came to PW1s house with the chain. The sequence of events is not convincing and does not stand to reason. According to the prosecution the appellant made a discovery statement to PW7 the Circle Inspector and pursuant to that statement PW7 went to the shop of PW8 Pradeep along with the appellant. The appellant is stated to have pointed out to PW8 as the man to whom he had sold the chain. However PW8 has not supported the prosecution case. The courts below have while convicting the appellant placed reliance on the evidence of PW7 the Circle Inspector and PW3 the Head Constable who sought to corroborate the version of PW7 regarding recovery of chain at the instance of the appellant from the shop of PW8. We find it difficult to do so. Trial Court has observed that offence under Section 457 of the IPC is not made out because according to PW1 the thieves entered the door which was kept open. The Trial Court therefore acquitted the appellant of the offence punishable under Section 457 of the IPC. The Trial Court also acquitted A1 and A3 of the offence punishable under Section 457 read with Section 34 of the IPC. The Trial Court however observed that from the evidence of PWs 1 and 2 it is seen that theft had taken in the room in which PW2 was sleeping the thief entered the house and committed theft of gold chain which PW2 was wearing and therefore this act will be covered by Section 451 of the IPC i.e. house trespass in order to commit offence punishable with imprisonment. The Trial Court further held that since the recovery of gold chain was effected on the basis of statement given by the appellant the only inference that can be drawn is that he committed the theft of gold chain and therefore the case is covered by Section 380 of the IPC i.e theft in a dwelling house. After observing that there is nothing in the evidence of PWs 1 to 8 to connect A1 and A3 with the crime the Trial Court acquitted them of all the offences. This view is affirmed by the Sessions Court and the High Court. We find it difficult to uphold the above view so far as it relates to the appellant. As we have already noted that FIR was registered after about sixteen days from the date of alleged theft. PWs 1 and 2 did not even realize that the chain was stolen. It is only when the accused were brought to their house after about sixteen days that they realized that the chain was stolen and FIR was lodged. The chain in question was being worn by PW2. It is stated to have been stolen while she was sleeping. It is inconceivable that she would not realize that she had lost her chain. The incident in our view is not unfolded truthfully. A1 and A3 have been rightly acquitted because nothing links them to the offence. But similar is the case with the appellant. The only evidence against him is the alleged recovery of gold chain at his instance. That cannot connect the appellant to the theft. The Trial Court has stated that since chain was recovered at the instance of the appellant the only inference which can be drawn is that he committed the theft. Drawing such inference in the facts of this case would be totally unjust.DECISION ?
116.0,Land Dispute, These appeals are directed against the judgment and order passed by the High Court of Judicature for Rajasthan Jaipur Bench Jaipur in Criminal Appeal No 130 of 2000 dated 03.06.2005. The High Court while affirming the judgment of the Trial Court in Sessions Case No 49 99 dated 15.03.2000 has convicted Shri Ram A 1 under Section 302 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code the IPC for short and reversed the judgment of the Trial Court and acquitted Shobha Ram A 2. It is the acquittal of A 2 which is called in question by the appellant  State of Rajasthan in Criminal Appeal No 592 of 2008. Criminal Appeal No 593 of 2008 is preferred by Shri Ram A 1 being aggrieved by the order of conviction and sentence passed by the Trial Court and confirmed by the High Court. The facts in brief are The incident occurred on 16.02.1999 at about 5.30 p.m. PW 1 Mohanlal who is the brother of the deceased Trilokchand had lodged the FIR before S.H.O Police Station Chechat regarding the alleged assault on the deceased by the accused persons. On the fateful day the appellants on account of their past enmity over the well located in their lands formed common intention to cause death of Trilokchand since deceased and in furtherance of their common intention they caused injuries to the deceased with stones resulting in his death. The FIR was registered and after the completion of the investigation the investigating agency had filed a charge sheet against A 1 and A 2 under Section 302 read with Section 34 of the IPC. The accused persons denied the charge and pleaded false implication and therefore the Trial had commenced against both the accused A 1 and A 2. During the Trial the prosecution in order to prove the guilt of the accused persons had examined several witnesses including PW 1 and PW 2 Smt. Manoharbai wife of the deceased PW 3 Bhawanishankar PW 4 Kalulal PW 6 Basantilal and other witnesses. Prosecution had projected PW 2 and PW 6 as eye witnesses to the incident. The Trial Court after appreciating the evidence of the eye witnesses and others has come to the conclusion that the testimony of PW 2 does not corroborate with the FIR and other material available on record and therefore it could be safely concluded that PW 2 had not seen the occurrence of actual incident and therefore the evidence at the most can only be an hearsay evidence. However the Trial Court has believed the evidence of PW 6 who in his evidence has categorically stated that A 1 was assaulting the deceased with the stones and A 2 was sitting on the chest of the deceased. The Trial Court placing reliance on the evidence of PW 6 has convicted and sentenced the accused persons under Section 302 read with Section 34 of the IPC to suffer imprisonment for life and to pay a fine of Rs1000 each and in default to undergo simple imprisonment for a further period of six months. Aggrieved by the order of conviction and sentence passed by the Trial Court the accused persons had filed appeals before the High Court. The High Court has confirmed the conviction and sentence of A 1 passed by the Trial Court. However the High Court has acquitted A 2 only on the ground that A 2 had not actively participated in the commission of the offence and therefore the Trial Court was not justified in convicting A 2 for an offence punishable under Section 302 read with Section 34 of the IPC. It is the correctness or otherwise of the judgment and order passed by the High Court which is called in question by the appellants in this appeal. We will first take up the appeal of A 1. The Trial Court and the High Court has convicted A 1 based on the evidence of the sole eye witness namely PW 6. In order to satisfy ourselves we have once again carefully analyzed the evidence on record and the conviction of A 1 by the Trial Court with the aid of the sole eye witness of PW 6. In his evidence PW 6 has stated A 2 was acting in concert with A 1 in causing the murder of the deceased wherein A 1 was assaulting the deceased with stones and A 2 had facilitated the execution of the common design by sitting on the chest of the deceased. Despite cross examination at length PW 6 has maintained his version thereby not leaving any scope for the defense to elicit anything against the prosecution witness. Therefore in our opinion the evidence of the said witness is of sterling quality and therefore reliable and trustworthy leaving us with no other alternative but to accept his evidence. Therefore we decline to interfere with the finding and conclusion reached by the Trial Court insofar as convicting A 1 is concerned. Therefore we reject the appeal filed by A 1 and confirm the orders passed by the Trial Court and the High Court. While considering the appeal filed by the State of Rajasthan we have carefully perused the judgment and order passed by the High Court. The High Court has acquitted A 2 only on the ground that merely sitting on the chest of the deceased rules out the possibility of active participation by A 2 in the commission of offence and therefore has acquitted him from the charges under Section 302 read with Section 34 of the IPC. The nuances of Section 34 of the IPC has been explained by this Court in several decisions but we will only refer to the decision in the case of Nadodi Jayaraman and others vs. State of Tamil Nadu 1992 3 SCC 161 and Saravanan and Another vs. State of Pondicherry 2004 13 SCC 238 . In the case of Nadodi Jayaraman and others Supra the Court has observed  9. Section 34 of IPC enacts that when a criminal act is done by several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if it were done by him alone. The section thus lays down a principle of joint liability in the doing of a criminal act. The essence of that liability is found in the existence of common intention animating the accused leading to the doing of a criminal act in furtherance of such intention. The section is intended to meet a case in which it is difficult to distinguish between the act of individual members of a party and to prove exactly what part was played by each of them. It therefore enacts that once it is found that a criminal act has been committed by several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all each of such persons is liable for the criminal act as if it were done by him alone. It is thus an exception to the general rule of criminal jurisprudence that it is the primary responsibility of the person who actually commits a crime and only that person can be held guilty and punished in accordance with law for his individual act. 15. It is thus clear that the criminal act referred to in Section 34 IPC is the result of the concerted action of more than one person if the said result was reached in furtherance of the common intention and each person must be held liable for the ultimate result as if he had done it himself.  A perusal of Section 34 of the IPC would clearly indicate that there must be two ingredients for convicting a person with the aid of Section 34 of the IPC. Firstly there must be a common intention and secondly there must be participation by the accused persons in furtherance of the common intention. If the common intention is proved it may not be necessary that the acts of the several persons charged with commission of an offence jointly must be the same or identically similar. The acts may be different in character but must be arising out of the same common intention in order to attract the provision. The said principle is reiterated in a three judge bench decision in Suresh Anr vs. State of U.P 2001 3 SCC 673 and Ramaswami Ayyangar and others vs. State of Tamil Nadu 1976 3 SCC 779 wherein the court has stated that the acts committed by different confederates in the criminal action may be different but all must in one way or the other participate and engage in the criminal enterprise for instance one may only stand guard to prevent any person coming to the relief of the victim or to otherwise facilitate the commission of crime. Such a person also commits an act as much as his co participants actually committing the planned crime. In the case of an offence involving physical violence the person who instigates or aids the commission of the crime must be physically present and such presence of those who in one way or the other facilitate the execution of the common design is itself tantamount to actual participation in the criminal act  Insofar as common intention is concerned it is a state of mind of an accused which can be inferred objectively from his conduct displayed in the course of commission of crime and also from prior and subsequent attendant circumstances. As observed in Hari Ram vs.State of U.P 2004 8 SCC 146 the existence of direct proof of common intention is seldom available and therefore such intention can only be inferred from the circumstances appearing from the proved facts of the case and the proved circumstances. Therefore in order to bring home the charge of common intention the prosecution has to establish by evidence whether direct or circumstantial that there was plan or meeting of mind of all the accused persons to commit the offence before a person can be vicariously convicted for the act of the other. The facts in the present case in the light of the evidences on record are that A 1 and A 2 are brothers having an old enmity with the deceased resulting in a constant skirmish over the well located in their lands. On the said date of incident the animosity culminated to an assault on the deceased by the accused persons when the deceased was nearing his land. It has come in the evidence of PW 6 that A 1 was assaulting the deceased with stones and A 2 was sitting on the chest of the deceased. The aforesaid chain of events gives a clear picture of the whole incident that had taken place on that fateful day. The evidence of PW 6 when seen in entirety and in its proper perspective we can conclude that both the accused persons i.e. A 1 and A 2 had a common intention to assault and kill the deceased person with A 2 as a participant in the crime with the intention of lending weight to the commission of an offence pursuant to a pre concerted plan.DECISION ?
117.0,Legal Judgement,"Appeal from the judgment and order dated March 11, 1957, of the Patna High Court, in Misc. Judicial Case No. 40 of 1957. C. Setalvad, Attorney-General for India,  Ganapathy Iyer R. H. Dhebar and T. M. Sen, for the appellants. P. Verma, for the respondent. 1961. November 21. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SHAH, J.- This is an appeal against the judgment of the High Court of Judicature at Patna from an order commanding the Accountant General of Bihar, Ranchi, to pay certain passage allowance due under the Superior Civil Services (Revision of Pay and Pension) Rules, 1924, to the wife and the children of the respondent. After passing the competitive examination held in London in August, 1924 the respondent N. bakshi was admitted in November, 1924 to the Indian Civil Service and was, after his arrival in India, posted in the Province of Bihar. He continued to serve in the State of Bihar after independence. On February 3, 1956, the respondent enquired of the Accountant General of Bihar about the number of passages to which he and the members of his family were entitled under the Superior Civil Services (Revision of Pay and Pension) Rules, 1924-hereinafter called the Statutory Rules. The Accountant General, by letter dated March 6, 1956, stated that 284-6 s. stood in the respondents credit 341-3-5d. stood in the account of his wife and 138 stood credited in the separate accounts of each of his four children. The respondent then arranged to travel to the United Kingdom and on June 20, 1956, obtained passage certificates from the Accountant General, Bihar. On July 12,1956, the respondent was informed that the Govt. of India were of the opinion that the passage benefits admissible to officers of Indian domicile under the said Statutory Rules, were inconsistent with the existing circumstances and it was decided, with effect from the date of issue of the order that the benefits shall cease and the passage accounts of Indian Officers of the former Secretary of State Services shall be closed and passage credit left over will lapse to the Government. On February 5, 1957, the Government of India framed, in exercise of the powers conferred by sub-s. (1) of s. 3 of the All India Services Act, 61 of 1951, the All India Services (Overseas Pay, Passage and Leave Salary) Rules, 1957. By cl. 3 of the Rules passage benefits provided by the statutory Rules ceased with retrospective effect from July 12, 1956, to apply to the members of the Indian Civil Service. The appellant protested against the cancellation of the passage benefits for himself and the members of his family. The Government of India waived the original order of July 12, 1956, in favour of the respondent and ordered that he be granted passage benefit for himself but declined to relax the order in favour of the wife and children of the respondent. The respondent accompanied by his wife and children proceeded to the United Kingdom as originally arranged and on his return filed a petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution for a writ in the nature of mandamus against the Accountant General, Bihar, commanding him to pay the prescribed passage money in respect of the respondents wife and children out of the amounts which stood to their credit in the General Passage Fund Account and to issue appropriate direction, order or writ in that behalf. This petition was granted by the High Court and a writ of mandamus as prayed was issued. The Accountant General and the Union of India have appealed to this Court against the order with certificate of fitness granted by the High Court. To appreciate the grounds on which the impugned order was made it is necessary to refer to the Statutory Rules for passage benefit framed in 1924 by the Secretary of State in Council and the amendments thereof in the light of constitutional development since that date. The Statutory Rules were framed by the Secretary of State for India-in-Council under s.96B(2) and (3) of the Government of India Act, 1919, on December 9, 1924. Rule 12 of the Statutory Rules provides  In addition to the pay prescribed by these Rules passage pay shall be granted at the rates and subject to the conditions set out in Schedule IV, to the members of the services and holders of appointments enumerated in Appendix A to that Schedule. Schedule IV appended to the Regulations set out an elaborate scheme for maintaining accounts of the passage pay and for disbursement thereof. Regulations 3, 5, 6(1),8,9 and 14, which are the material regulations stood as follows-  There shall be payable to every officer with effect from the 1st day of April, 1924 passage pay at the rate of Rs. 50 per mensem or such different rate as the Governor General in Council may by order declare to be necessary or sufficient for the purpose of the provision of the benefits conferred by these regulations. A sum equal to the amount received by an officer as passage pay shall be deducted monthly from the officers pay or leave salary, as the case may be, and shall be credited to a General Passage Fund to be administered by the Governor-General in Council. 6 (1)The maximum benefits to which officer shall be entitled shall be passages of a total value equal to the cost of the number of passages between Bombay and London by P. O., 1st Class B, shown below-  A separate account shall be opened in sterling in the case of each officer, and, if such officer is married, for his wife, and, if he has children, for each child. These accounts shall be credited respectively with the cost of the passages to which the officer, his wife and children are entitled under Regulation 6  No person whosoever shall have any claim on the General Passage Fund beyond the provision of the benefits, if any, conferred on him by these regulations and any balance remaining at the credit of any person after such person has ceased to be eligible for any such benefits shall lapse to the Fund. Passage benefit provided under Rule 12 was clearly part of the salary to be paid out of a fund called the General Passage Fund which was formed out of the passage pay. Several amendments were made to these Rules from time to time, but we are concerned with the amendments made by Notifications No. F-178/11/1/24 dated October 5, 1925, and No. F-17-15/26 dated June 16, 1926. Rule 12, as amended, reads as follows-  In addition to the pay prescribed by these Rules, passages shall be granted, subject to the conditions set out in Schedule IV, to the members of the services and holders of appointments enumerated in Appendix A to that Schedule. The Regulations under Sch. IV were, after the amendment, called Revision of Pay, Passage and Pension Regulations. Original regulations 3, 4 and 5 were omitted and regulations 6, 8, 11 and 14 were 6 amended. The effect of these amendments was that instead of allowing as part of salary, passage pay of Rs. 50/- and carrying over that amount to the credit of the officer concerned in the General Passage Fund, by cl. 6 of the Regulations it was directed that a separate passage account be opened for each officer and if he be married for his wife and children, if any. Subject to Regulations, the accounts wire to be credited respectively with the number of passages to which the officer, his wife and children were entitled under the new regulations. Within the limits of these credits, the officer was entitled to draw for himself, his wife and his children respectively the port of a journey between a port in India and a port outside Asia. Whereas by the Rules as originally framed in 1924 an additional salary of Rs. 50/- per mensem was awarded to each officer as passage pay which was to be credited to the General Passage Fund out of which passage benefits to officers were provided, according to the scheme of the Rules as amended in 1926, a separate passage account was to be maintained for each officer for the maximum benefits prescribed by Rule 3 and the disbursement in respect thereof were to be made of the General Revenue of the State. By the amendment made in the Rules in 1926, the passage benefit ceased to be a part of the salary and became an allowance or privilege. The respondent obtained benefit of these passages in 1930, 1950-51 and 1952-53 for himself and the members of his family. In 1957 he has not granted the passage benefit for his wife and his children, and he has filed this petition under Art. 226 for an order that the Union of India and the Accountant General do carry out their Statutory obligations. The conditions of the to which members of the Indian Civil Service were entiled under the Government of India Act, 1919, were guaranteed to them by s.247(1) of the Government of India Act, 1935. That Section provided 247 (1). The conditions of service of all persons appointed to a civil service or civil post by the Secretary of State shall- (a) as respects pay, leave and pension and general rights in regard to medical attendance, be such as may be prescribed by rules to be made by the Secretary of State (b) as respects other matters with respect to which express provision is not made by this chapter, be such as may be prescribed by rules to be made by the Secretary of State in so far as he thinks fit to make such rules, and, in so far and so long as provision is not made by such rules, by rules to be made, as respects persons serving in connection with the affairs of the Federation, by the Governor-General or some person or persons authorised by the Governor- general to make rule for the purpose and, as respects persons serving in connection with the affairs of a Province, by the Governor of the Province or some person or persons authorised by the Governor to make rules for the purpose Provided that no rule made under this sub-Section shall have effect so as to give to any person appointed to a civil service or civil post by the Secretary of State less favorable terms as respect remuneration or pension than were given to him by the rules is force on the date on which he was first appointed to his service or was appointed to his post. The proviso makes it abundantly clear that the power to make rules cannot be exercised by the Secretary of State so as to give to any officer of the class specified terms less favorable as respects remuneration or pension than were given to him by the rules in force on the date on which he was first appointed to his service or to his post. This guarantee was confirmed by s. 10, sub.s. (2) of the Indian Independence Act, 1947, wherein it was provided, in so far as it is material, that Every person who- (a) havining been appointed by the Secretary of State or Secretary of State in Council, to a civil service of the Crown in India continues on and after the appointed day to serve under the Government of either of the new Dominions or of any province or part thereof or (b) shall be entitled to receive from the Governments of the Dominions and Provinces or parts which he is from time to time serving or, as the case may be the same conditions of service as respects remuneration, leave and pension, and the same rights as respects disciplinary matters or as the case may be, as respects the tenure of his office, or rights as similar thereto as changed circumstances may permit, as that person was entitled to immediately before the appointed day. The expression remuneration was defined in s.19(4) of that Act as inclusive of leave pay, allowances and the cost of any privileges or facilities provided in kind. By Art. 314 of the Constitution, persons who were appointed by the Secretary of State or Secretary of State in Council to a civil service of the Crown in India and continue on and after the commencement of the Constitution to serve under the Government of India or of a State were to receive from the Government of India and the Government of the State which they were from time to time serving, the same conditions of service as respects remuneration leave as pension which they were entitled to immediately before such commencement. The Parliament of India enacted the All India Services Act, 61 of 1951, to regulate the recruitment, and the conditions of service of persons appointed, to the all India Services common to the Union and the States, and by s. 3 of that Act the central Government was authorised to make rules for the regulation of recruitment, and the conditions of service of persons appointed, to the All India Service. By s. 4 it was provided that all rules in force immediately before the commencement of the Act and applicable to an All India Service were to continue to by in force and were to be deemed to be rules made under the Act. On September 8, 1954, the Central Government framed rules called the Indian Administrative Services Recruiting Rules and by Rule 2(d) the members of the Indian Civil Service who continued to serve on and after the commencement of the Constitution were to be regarded for the purpose of the rules as members of the Indian Administrative Service. On February 15, 1957, the All India Services Overseas Pay, Passage and Leave Salary Rules, 1957, were promulgated in exercise of the powers conferred by sub-s (1) of s.3 of the All India Services Act, 1951, and thereby passage benefits in favour of the members of the Indian Administrative Service, who were originally members of the Indian Civil Service were cancelled. The only question which falls to be determined in this appeal is whether cl. 3 of the All India Services (overseas Pay, Passage and Leave Salary) Rules, 1957, was competently enacted, having regard to the guarantee contained in Art. 314 of the constitution as to the conditions of service as respects remuneration, leave and pension of the persons appointed by the Secretary of State or Secretary of State for India in Council to a civil service of the Crown in India. Since the All India Services Act was enacted there is manifestly no existing service known as the Indian Civil Service. The members of the Indian Civil Service who were appointed by the Secretary of State for India became members of the Indian Administrative service, but their rights in the matter of condition of service as respects remuneration, leave and pension stood guaranteed by Art.314. In dealing with the status of the members of the former Indian Civil Service since the Indian Independence Act, 1947, this Court in State of Madras v. K. M. Rajagopalan (1) held that (1) the conferral of independence on India brought about an automatic and legal termination of service on the date of Independence (2) all persons previously holding civil posts in India are deemed to have been appointed and hence to continue in service, except those governed by General or special orders arrangements affecting their respective case (3) the guarantee about prior conditions of service and the previous statutory safe guards relating to disciplinary action continues to apply to those who are thus deemed to continue in service but not to others and (4) those previously holding civil posts in India had the right, and were in fact given the option, of declining to continue in service under the new regime and in the event of their exercising that option they ceased to serve on and from the date of the passing of the constitution. Under the Statutory Rules framed in 1924 passage benefits granted to persons employed in the Indian Civil Service, their wives and children were expressly made part of the salary or remuneration. Under the amendment of 1926, these passage benefits acquired the character of allowance, privilege or facility of office. By the Act of 1935 (s. 247) privileges, inter alia as to remuneration under the Government of India Act of 1919 were expressly guaranteed in favour of the members of the India civil Services.By the Indian Independence Act 1947, a similar guarantee in respect of conditions of service as respects remuneration was also conferred and by s. 19(4) of that Act remuneration was defined as inclusive of pay, allowances or privileges or facilities payable in kind. By Art. 314 of the Constitution, the conditions of service, prior to the Constitutions respects remuneration, leave and pension of the members of the Indian Civil Service were protected. There is no definition of remuneration the Constitution, but that is not a ground for holding that the expression is used in any limited sense as merely salary. The expression remuneration, in its ordinary connotation means reward, recompense, pay, wages or salary for service rendered In R. v. Postmaster General (1) Blackbrun, J., observed, I think the word remuneration means a quid pro quo. If a man gives his services whatever consideration he gets for giving his services seems to be a remuneration for them. Consequently, I think if a person was in receipt of a Payment, or in receipt of a percentage, or any kind of payment which would not be actual money payment, the amount he would receive annually in respect of this would be remuneration. The expression remuneration appears to have been used in the Constitution in this wide connotation. As already observed, the right to passage was originally made part of the salary, but under the Rules framed in 1926, the provision for setting apart a fixed sum of money as salary out of the General Passage Fund was altered and passages were credited to the account of members of Civil services and debited and when they were availed of out of the general Revenue of the State. This alteration was made merely for administrative convenience and did not alter the character of the benefit. Under the Rules of 1924, the provision for passage port of the remuneration and it continued to be such even after the amendment of the Rules in 1926 The right to passage benefits was statutory, and was under the Indian Independence Act in the nature of an allowance, or in any event privilege or facility paid in kind. It was expressly made part of the remuneration earned by the numbers of the Indian Civil Service. The Conditions of service as to remuneration having been guaranteed, the right to this benefit remained guaranteed to those members of the Indian Civil Service who were entitled to it before the Constitutions. This guarantee which was continued in force even after the Commencement of the Constitution was for the first time by Rules made in June 1957 by retrospective amendment of the Statutory Rules from July 12, 1956 sought to be cancelled. But the central Government in exercise of Rule making power was incompetent to destroy or cancel a constitutional guarantee.DECISION ??"
118.0,Legal Judgement,"Appeal from the judgment and order dated December 21, 1961, of the Calcutta High Court in Cr. A. No. 423 of 1958. K. Chakravarty, for the appellant. C. Mazumdar, for respondent No. 1. N. Mukherjee, P. K. Mukherjee for P. K. Bose, for the respondent No. 2. 1962. August 3. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SINHA, C.J.-This appeal on a certificate of fitness granted by the High Court under Act 134(1), (c). of the Constitution, is directed against the order of a Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court dated December 21, 1960, setting aside the order of acquittal passed by the trial Magistrate, dated July 2, 1958. We heard this appeal on the eve of the long vacation and pronounced our order to the effect that the appeal was allowed and the order of acquittal was to stand, and that reasons would be given later. It appears that the appellant, who it a practising lawyer, had been employed by the respondent to work for him to investigate the title to some property which the latter was about to purchase, sometime in October 1952. The prosecution case was that the respondent had entrusted the. sum of Rs. 5000/- to the appellant for depositing in Court in connection with an application in respect of the proposed transaction, under the Bengal Money Lenders Act, and that the appellant having been so entrusted with the money, in breach of trust, misappropriated the amount, thus causing loss to his client. The appellant was, therefore, charged under s. 409 of the Indian Penal Code, with having committed criminal breach of trust in respect of the sum of Rs. 5000/- , which had been entrusted to him as a lawyer on behalf of the respondent. The appellant defense was that the case, against him was false and that he had been falsely implicated for reasons which need not be stated. In order to substantiate the charge against him, the complainant (now respondents examined himself and a number of witnesses. He also adduced in evidence a certain document, marketed Ex. 1, purporting to be a letter in the handwriting of the appellant, to show that Rs. 4200/- being a portion of the amount of Rs. 5000/- required for the deposit, had been asked for by the appellant. It also con- tained writings in the hand of the complainant owing that there was correspondence in the matter of the deposit. That was a very important piece of evidence, which if genuine could go a long way to prove the case against the appellant. But the appellant challenged the document as a forgery in material parts, and cross- examined the complainant who had produced the document. In spite of the fact that the complainant was very pointedly cross-examined with a view to showing that the document placed before the Court was a forgery in material parts, the complainant did not take any steps to get an expert on handwriting examined. The trial Court, on an examination of-the evidence, oral and documentary, came to the conclusion that the case against the accused had not been proved and acquitted him. The complainant preferred an appeal to the High Court against the order of acquittal, which was heard by a Division Bench, The High Court took the view that, in the circumstances of the case, there should be retrial by another magistrate, who should give an opportunity to the complainant to adduce the evidence of a handwriting expert in order to establish the genuineness of the questioned document. Apparently, the High court, sitting in appeal on the judgment of the acquittal, passed by the learned Magistrate, was not satisfied as to the genuineness of the questioned document. Otherwise it could have pronounced its judgment one way or the other, on the merits of the controversy, whether or not the prosecution had succeeded in bringing the charge home to the accused. If it were not a case between a lawyer as an accused and his client as the complainant, perhaps the High Court may not have taken the unusual course of giving a fresh opportunity to the complainant to have second round of litigation, to the great prejudice of the accused. In this connection, the following observations of the High Court may be extracted in order to show the reasons.for the unusual course it took in this case Thus there can be no doubt that this was a document of considerable importance. According to the prosecution it clearly showed the respondents connection with the sum of Rs. 4200/- which was a part of the sum of Rs. 5000/-, the subject matter of the charge. According to the respondent, the figures 4200 and the Bengali word sankranta were for- geries just as at the bottom of the document the word yes and the signature of the res- pondent with date were also forgeries. This case was clearly put by the respondent to Bimla, Krishna Ben and it was suggested to him that the- impugned portions of the document were clear forgeries made by the appellant in order to falsely implicate the respondent. It must be said that inspite of this challenge, the appellant took no steps what. ever to produce expert evidence to aid the court in coming to a conclusion as to the authorship of the impugned portion of the document. It is true that expert evidence cannot always be a final settler still in a call of this kind, it is eminently desirable that the court should be assisted by a qualified expert since almost the whole case depends upon proof of the fact whether the impugned portions of that document were in the hand of the respondent Comment was also made by the Magistrate on the appellants failure to call expert evidence. In one sense that comment was justified but in a case of this kind between lawyer and client we think the matter cannot be left, where it is. In view of the fiduciary relation. ship between the parties it is as much necessary in the interest of, the prosecution as in. the interest of the accused that the whole matter should be cleared up, and no steps should be spared which might ensure complete justice between the parties. If it were an ordinary case between one litigant and another, we might have hesitated at this dis- tance of time to send the case back even though the prosecution did not avail of the opportunity of proving its own case. In all civilised countries, criminal jurisprudence has firmly established the rule that an accused person should not be placed on trial for the same offence more than once, except in very exceptional circumstances. In this case, the complainant had the fullest opportunity of adducing all the evidence that he was advised would be necessary to prove the charge against the accused person. It was not that he proved for the examination of an expert and that opportunity had been denied to him. The prosecution took its chance of having a decision in its favour on the evidence adduced by it before the trial Court.That Court was not satisfied that evidence was adequately reliable to bring the charge home to the accused. The accused was thus acquitted. On appeal, it was open to the High Court to take a different view of the evidence, if the facts and circumstances placed before it could lead to the conclusion that the appreciation of the evidence by the trial Court was so thoroughly erroneous as to be wholly unacceptable to the Appellate Court. If the High Court could come to the conclusion, it could have reversed the judgment and converted the order of acquittal into an order of conviction. But it should not have put the accused to the botheration and expense of a second trial simply because the prosecution did not adduce all the evidence that should, and could, have been brought before the Court of first instance. It is not a case where it in open to the Court of Appeal, against an order of acquittal, to order a retrial for the reasons that the trial Court has not given the prosecution full opportunity to adduce all available evidence in support of the prosecution case. It has no where been suggested that the trial Magistrate had unreasonably refused any opportunity to the prosecution to adduce all the evidence that it was ready and willing to produce. That being so, the High Court, in our judgment, entirely misdirected itself in setting aside the order of acquittal and making an order for a fresh trial by another Magistrate, simply on the ground that the case was between a lawyer and his client. Simply because the accused happened to be a lawyer would not be a ground for subjecting him to harassment a second time, there being no reason for holding that his prosecutor had not a fair chance of bringing the charge home to him. In our opinion, the High Court gave way to considerations which were not relevant to a criminal trial. The High Court was not sitting on a disciplinary proceeding for professional misconduct. It had to apply the same rules of criminal jurisprudence as. apply to all criminal trials, and, in our opinion, the only. reason given by the High Court for ordering retrial is against all well-established rules of criminal jurisprudence. The fact that the appellant is a practising lawyer does not entitle him to any preferential treatment when he is hauled up on a criminal charge, even as he is not subject to any additional disability because the cam was between a lawyer and his client. There was no relationship of lawyer and client so far as the criminal case was concerned.DECISION ??"
119.0,Legal Judgement, Special leave granted. Respondent 1 was suspended by order dated 28 7 1998 on the same day when disciplinary proceedings were initiated against him. He filed a writ petition in the High Court challenging the order of suspension. By the impugned order the High Court noted that Respondent I had been empanelled for promotion to the post of Joint Commissioner on 28 5 1998 and the disciplinary proceedings commenced on 28 7 1998 and on the same day i.e 28 7 1998 he was suspended. From this the High Court concluded that the act of suspension was an after thought. Consequently the High Court directed that no effect should be given to the order of suspension and the select list for promotion should be given effect to forthwith. We are at a loss the understand as to how the High Court could pass such an order. Admittedly the disciplinary proceedings had commenced on 28 7 1998. Even if before that date the said respondent had been empanelled for promotion the Government cannot be prohibited from starting disciplinary proceedings if there are reasons for doing so. The High Court has not quashed the disciplinary proceedings and looking at the charges leveled against the respondent it cant of be said that there was any ulterior motive for the respondent being put under suspension. Furthermore where disciplinary proceedings are pending we are doubtful whether it was appropriate for the High Court to have directed that the select list for promotion should be given effect to forthwith especially when the High Court in the said order has permitted the disciplinary proceedings to continue. It is also difficult to appreciate the High Court holding that even though disciplinary proceedings could continue but no final order should be passed. No reasons for coming to this conclusion have been given. We therefore have no hesitation in set ting aside the impugned judgment of the High Court. The effect of this would be that Respondent 1 who was reinstated pursuant to an order passed by the High Court during the proceedings for contempt which are stated to have been initiated by the respondent would be placed under suspension forthwith till the conclusion of the disciplinary proceedings or the withdrawal of the suspension order by the Government.DECISION ?
120.0,Tax,"CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION Civil Appeal No. 46 of 1950. Appeal by special leave from a judgment of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay dated 23rd March, 1948, (Chagla C.J. and Tendolkar J.) in Income Tax Reference No. 16 of 1947. C. Setalvad, Attorney-General for India (Gopal Singh, with him) for the appellant. C. Chatterjee (B. Sen, with him)for the respondent. 1951. September 18. The Judgment of the Court was deliv- ered by MAHAJAN J.--The sole controversy in this appeal centres round the point as to whether or not excess profits tax is payable on the sum of Rs. 20,005 received by the respondent from Messrs Parakh Co. by way of rent for the dyeing plant let out to them during the chargeable accounting period. The respondent (Sri Lakshmi Silk Mills Ltd.) is a manu- facturer of silk cloth, and as a part of its business it installed a plant for dyeing silk yarn. During the charge- able accounting period (1st January, 1943, to 31st December, 1943) owing to difficulty in obtaining silk yarn on account of the war it could make no use of this plant and it re- mained idle for some time. On the 20th August, 1943, it was let out to Messrs E. Parakh Co. on a rent of Rs. 4,001 per month. The Excess Profits Tax Officer by his assessment order dated 11th June, 1945, included the sum of Rs. 20,005 realized as rent for five months, in the profits of the business of the respondent and held that excess profits tax was payable on this amount. This order was confirmed on appeal by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and on fur- ther appeal by the Income-tax Tribunal. The Tribunal, however, on being asked referred the following question of law to the High Court for its opinion Whether in the circumstances of the case, the asses- sees income of Rs. 20,005 is profits from business within the meaning of section 2 (5) of the Excess Profits Tax Act and therefore or otherwise liable to pay excess profits tax ? The High Court answered the question in the negative. This is an appeal by special leave from this decision. It was contended on behalf of the Commissioner before the High Court that the dyeing plant was a commercial asset of the assessees business for the purpose of earning profit and if this commercial asset yielded income to him in any particular manner, it was income from the assessees busi- ness for the purpose of the Excess Profits Tax Act. It was said that it was immaterial whether a commercial asset yields income by use of the assessee himself or its being used by someone else. This contention was disposed of by the learned Chief Justice in these words - Mr. Joshi seems to be right but with this qualification that the commercial asset must be at the time it was let out in a condition to be used as a commercial asset by the assessee. If it has ceased to be a commercial asset, if its use as a commercial asset has been discontinued, then if the assessee lets it out, he is not putting to use something which is a commercial asset at the time. Now, on the facts found by the Tribunal, it is clear that when the assessee let out this dyeing plant, it had remained idle for some time. He could not obtain silk yarn on account of the war and therefore it was not possible to make use of it as a commercial asset as far as the assessee himself was concerned and it was only for that reason that he let it out to Messrs E. Parakh Co. I can understand the principle for which Mr. Joshi is contending that it makes no difference what an assessee does with a commercial asset belonging to him. He may use it as he likes. So long as it yields income it is the income of his business. Var- ious cases have been cited at the Bar and I think that those cases though apparently conflicting are reconcilable if we accept this principle to be the correct principle and apply this ratio as the ratio emerging from these cases and I will state the principle and the ratio again that if an assessee derives income from a commercial asset which is capable at the time of being used as a commercial asset, then it is income from his business, whether he uses that commercial asset himself or lets it out to somebody else to be used. But if the commercial asset is not capable of being used as such, then its being let out does not result in an income which is the income of the business. Mr. Justice Tendolkar concurred in this view and ob- served as follows -- The ratio of all these cases to my mind is that if there is a commercial asset which is capable of being worked by the assessee himself for the purpose of earning profits and the assessee instead of doing so, either voluntarily allows someone else to use it on payment of a certain sum or is compelled by law to allow it to be used in such manner, then what he receives is income from business. But if the commercial asset has ceased to be a commercial asset in the hands of the assessee and thereafter he gets what he can out of it by letting it out to be used by others, then the rent he receives is not income from any business that he carries on. The learned Attorney-General pointed out that the nature of a commercial asset is not changed because a par- ticular person is unable to use it. The inability of the assessee to make use of it in certain circumstances does not in any way affect the nature of the asset and cause an infirmity in the asset itself. It was contended that when the dyeing plant became idle for a short time during the chargeable accounting period it did not cease to be a com- mercial asset of the respondent for it had no other busi- ness that all the assets of the respondent including the dyeing plant were the assets of the business, that whatever income was derived by the use of these assets including the income that an asset fetched by its being let out was the business income of the assessee, and that there was no warrant in law for the proposition that a commercial asset which yields income must be used as an asset by the respondent himself before its income becomes chargeable to tax. The learned counsel for the respondent urged that as soon as the assessee found difficulty in obtaining yarn the dyeing plant became redundant for its business and ceased to be an asset of its business and any income derived from the rent by letting out this asset was income received by the assessee from other sources and therefore was not charge- able to excess profits tax. In our opinion, the contention raised by the learned Attorney-General is sound. The High Court was in error in engrafting a proviso on the rule deduced by it from the authorities considered by it, to the effect that a commer- cial asset of a business concern which yields income must at the time it was let out be in a condition to be used as a commercial asset by the assessee himself. We respectfully concur in the opinion of the learned Chief Justice that if the commercial asset is not capable of being used as such, then its being let out to others does not result in an income which is the income of the business, but we cannot accept the view that an asset which was acquired and used for the purpose of the business ceased to be a commercial asset of that business as soon as it was temporarily put out of use or let out to another person for use in his business or trade. The yield of income by a commercial asset is the profit of the business irrespective of the manner in which. that asset is exploited by the owner of the business. He is entitled to exploit it to his best advantage and he may do so either by using it himself personally or by letting it out to somebody else. Suppose, for instance, in a manufac- turing concern the use of its plant and machinery can advan- tageously be made owing to paucity of raw materials only for six hours in a working day, and in order to get the best yield out of it, another person who has got the requisite raw materials is allowed to use it as a licensee on payment of certain consideration for three hours can it be said in such a situation with any justification that the amount realized from the licensee is not a part of the business income of the licensor. In this case the company was incorporated purely as a manufacturing concern with the object of making profit. It installed plant and machinery for the purpose of its business, and it was open to it if at any time it found that any part of its plant for the time being could not be advantageously employed for earning profit by the company itself, to earn profit by leasing it to somebody else. It is difficult to hold that the income thus earned by the commer- cial asset is not income from the business of the company that has been solely incorporated for the purpose of doing business and earning profits. There is no material whatever for taking the view that the assessee company was incorpo- rated with any other object than of carrying on business or trade. Owning properties and letting them was not a purpose for which it was formed and that being so, the disputed income cannot be said to fall under any section of the Indian Income-tax Act other than section 10. Cases of undertakings of this nature stand on an entirely different footing and are distinguishable from cases of individuals or companies acquiring lands or buildings and making income by letting them on hire. These latter cases may legitimately fall under the specific provisions of section 9 or section 12, though the High Courts in this country are by no means unanimous on this subject but for the purpose of this case it is unnecessary to resolve that conflict. It may be observed that no general principle can be laid down which is applicable to all cases, and each case has to be decided on its own circumstances. Decisions of the Eng- lish courts given under the Finance Acts, the scheme of which is different from the Indian Income-tax statutes, are not always very helpful in dealing with matters arising under the Indian law and analogies and inferences drawn from those decisions are at times misleading. We, however, are in respectful agreement with the observations of Lord President Strathclyde in Sutherland v. The Commissioners of Inland Revenue(1) that if a commercial asset is susceptible of being put to a variety of different uses in which gain might be acquired, whichever of these uses it was put to by the appellant, the profit earned was a user of the asset of the same business. A mere substituted use of the commercial asset does not change or alter the nature of that asset. Whatever the commercial asset produces is income of the business of which it is an asset, the process by which the asset makes the income being immaterial. Mr. Chatterjee for the respondent stressed the point that as the dyeing plant in the present case could not be made use of by the assessee in its manufacturing business owing to the non-availability of yarn, it ceased to be a commercial asset of the business of the assessee and became redundant to that business and that being so, any income earned by this asset which had ceased to be a commercial asset was not an income of the business but must be held to have been derived from a source other than business and fell within the ambit of section 12 of the Indian Income tax Act, and on this income excess profits tax was not payable. He contended that the facts of this case were analogous to the case of Inland Revenue Commissioners v. lies(2) and it should be similarly decided. In that case the taxpayer carried on the business of sand and gravel merchant on certain land and at the same time he granted licences to three firms to enter his land and win gravel for themselves in return for which he received from them a royalty for each cubic yard of gravel taken away. It was held that the royalties were not part of the profits of the business because, in granting the licences, the taxpayer was exploit- ing his rights of ownership in the land and was not carrying on his business of a sand and gravel merchant. The income was held taxable as an income from an investment and did not fall under Schedule D which concerns profits earned from a trade. Mr. Chatterjee also laid emphasis on the observations of Lord (1) (1918) 12 Tax Cas. 63. (2) 1947 1 A.E.R. 798. Greene M.R. in Croft v. Sywell Aerodrome Ltd. (1), wherein the learned Master of the Rolls observed as fol- lows I cannot myself see that a person who leases the land to others, or grants licences to others to come upon it, is doing anything more than exploiting his own rights of property, even if the tenant or licensee is, by the terms of the lease or licence, entitled himself to carry on a trade on the land. It was urged that what the assessee was doing in this case was exploiting his rights of property by letting the dyeing plant to other persons precisely in the same manner as the owner of land in the case cited above was exploiting his own rights to property by granting a licence to another to come on his land. The argument, in our opinion, though attractive, is fallacious. The analogy between the case of land and of a dyeing plant for the purpose of taxing stat- utes is inappropriate. The distinction becomes apparent from the following passage which occurs in Atkinson J.s judgment in I less case(2) -- Then it was suggested by counsel for the Crown that the case was like the Desoutter case(3), where it was held that, if you make use of a patent in your business and also receive royalties from the use of the patent by others licensed to use it, those royalties cannot be regarded as receipts from an investment. In other words, the door has to be either open or shut. A patent is either an investment or it is not. The suggestion was that freehold land is in the same position, and if you carry on business on part of it, whatever you do with the rest by way of licensing or letting cannot be regarded as producing income from investment. That, however, is dead in the teeth of the judgment in the Broadway Car Co. case(4). The same argument was tried there, but Tucker L.J. said he thought the Desoutter case(3) had very little to do with it, as there was a great difference between land (1) 1942 1 A.E.R. 110. (3) 1946 1  E.R. 58. (2) 1947 1 A.E.R. 798 (4) 1946 2  E.R. 609. and a patent, and he did not think the Desoutter case(1) threw any light on the matter A patent is quite different from freehold land. These observations appositely apply to the case of a company incorporated for the purpose of doing business and earning profit by the process of manufacture. Letting out a part of its machinery in a certain situation in order to make the business advantageous as a whole does not alter the nature of the income. The case of an owner of land letting out his land and carrying on exploitation of part of that land by selling gravel out of it, as at present advised, in our opinion, would fall under section 9 of the Indian In- come-tax Act, as income earned, no matter by whatever meth- od, from land, and specifically dealt with by that section. The observations therefore made in I less case(2) can have no apposite application to the case of a manufacturing concern letting out a part of its machinery temporarily which it cannot advantageously use itself. Mr. Chatterjee also laid stress on the decision of the Court of Appeal in Inland Revenue Commissioners v. Broadway Car Co. Ltd.(3). In this case the company carried on the business of motor car agents and repairers on land held on lease from 1935 to 1956 at an annual rent of pound 750. By 1940 the companys business had dwindled under war condi- tions to such an extent that no more than one third of the land was required.  In those circumstances the remainder was sublet for fourteen years at an annual rent of pound 1,150. The general commissioners of income-tax decided that the difference of pound 400 between the outgoing of pound 750 for the land retained and the incoming of pound 1,150 for the land disposed of was income received from an invest- ment, and, the business not being one within the special categories mentioned in the Finance Act, 1939, that pound 400 was not taxable.  It was held that the word investment must be construed in the ordinary, popular sense of the word as used by businessmen and not as a (1) 1946 1 A.E.R.58. (3) 1946 2 A.E.R. 609. (2) 1947 1 A.E.R. 798. term of art having a defined or technical meaning and that it was impossible to say that the commissioners had erred in law in coming to the conclusion that the transaction result- ed in an investment. Scott L.J. in delivering his judgment laid emphasis on the point that after the business of the company had dwindled, it partitioned part of the land from the rest and sublet it by installing a heating apparatus for the sub-lessee.  It was found that war conditions had reduced the companys business to very small proportions and they cut their loss by going out of business in respect of the major part of their land and put it out of their power for 14 years to resume business there. In this situation it was observed that in that case they were dealing with part of the property of the company which had come redundant and was sublet purely to produce income--a transaction. quite apart from the ordinary business activities of the company.  It was pointed out that the question whether a particular source of income was income or not must be decided, as it could be, according to ordinary commonsense principles. The short question to decide in this case is whether on the facts found, it could be said reasonably that the dyeing plant had become redundant for its business as a silk manu- facturing concern, simply by the circumstance that for the time being it could not be used by it personally for the purpose of dyeing silk yarn owing to the non-availability of yarn. It is difficult to conceive that the company would not have immediately started dyeing yarn as soon as it became available. Instead of dyeing yarn, another person was allowed to dye jute (we are told), the assessee company making income out of its use as a commercial asset. DECISION ??"

Das and Mukherjee JJ.) in Income-tax Reference No. 11 of 1948. Mitra (S. N. Mukherjee, with him) for the appellant. C. Setalvad, Attorney-General for India (S.M. Sikri, with him) for the respondent. 1951. May 4. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Boss J.--This is an assessees appeal from a judgment of the High Court at Calcutta delivered on a reference made to it under section 66(1 )of the Incometax Act. The question submitted for the High CourtS opinion was as follows-- Whether in the circumstances of this case, the interest paid by the assessee on debentures was incurred solely for the purpose of making or earning such income, profits or gains which are assessable under sub-section (1) of section 12. The assessee is a private limited company which was incor- porated on 3rd January, 1927. It is an investment company known as the Eastern Investments Limited. The objects set out in the memorandum of association are to buy, sell and otherwise deal with shares, securities, bonds and so forth generally. The company was originally formed for acquiring, holding and otherwise dealing with shares and Government securities which had previously belonged to one Lord Cable. The share capital of the company at the date of its incorpo- ration was 250 lacs and consisted partly of preference shares and partly of ordinary shares. Of these Lord Cable held the majority including the 50,000 ordinary shares of the face value of Rs. 50,00,000 with which we are here concerned. The rest of the share capital was held by the nominees of the late Lord Cable. Lord Cable died on the 28th of March, 1937, leaving an estate in Great Britain as well as in India. One Geoffrey Lacy Scott was appointed administrator of his estate in India and held these 50,000 shares in question in that capacity. According to the statement of the case drawn up by the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal in its. reference to the High Court, money was needed by the executors of Lord Cable, and accordingly the administrator of the estate in India reached an agreement with the company on 9th February, 1937, the terms of which were as follows - The company agreed to reduce its share capital by Rs. 50 lacs and to do it by taking over from Scott the 50,000 shares mentioned above which stood in Lord Cables name at the rate of Rs. 100 a share. Scott on his part agreed to forego cash payment and agreed instead to receive debentures of the face value of Rs. 50 lacs carrying interest at 5 per cent. per annum redeemable at the option of the registered holder at any time. The sanction of the Calcutta High Court was obtained in due course and the agreement was carried out by the parties. The 5 per cent. interest paid to Scott on these deben- tures forms the subject-matter of the question before the Court. The company claims to deduct this from its income as part of its working expenses under section 12 (2) of the Income-tax Act, that is to say, to use the words of the section, as expenditure (not being in the nature of capital expend- iture) incurred solely for the purpose of making or earning such income, profits or gains. This contention failed before the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal and also before the High Court. It was agreed all through that the expenditure was not in the nature of capi- tal expenditure, but the view of the Income-tax Commissioner is that (a) it is not expenditure incurred for the purpose of earning the income, profits and gains of the company and (b) that even if it is, it is at any rate not expenditure incurred solely for that purpose. In general, the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal and the High Court both took that view. The grounds on which these conclusions were based may be summarised as follows (1) the purpose of the agreement was to effect the conversion without in any way disturbing the holding of the investments of the company or interfering with the earning of its income (2) by this transaction the taxable income of the compa- ny was diminished  There was complete identity of the person who -- (a) brought about this transaction without disturbing the affairs of the company, (b) to whom the share money was repaid. and (c) who took up the debentures and (4) that the transaction was more in the interest of the shareholder Scott than that of the company.  The decision of this appeal rests on the true construc- tion of section 12 (2). In our Opinion, the law on this point has been correctly summarised in the judgment of the High Court. The following principles are relevant (a) though the question must be decided on the facts of each case, the final conclusion is one of law Indian Radio Cable Communications Ltd. v. The Commissioner of Income- tax, Bombay(1) and Tara Hydro-Electric Agencies Ltd. v. The Commissioner of Income-tax, Bombay(2) (b) it is not necessary to show that the expenditure was a profitable one or that in fact any profit was earned Moore v. Stewart Lloyds(3) and Ushers case(4) (c) it is enough to show that the money was expended not of necessity and with a view to a direct and immediate benefit to the trade, but voluntarily and on the ground of commercial expediency. and in order indirectly to facilitate the carrying on of the business British Insulated Helsby Cables Ltd. v. Atherton(5) and (d) beyond that no hard and fast rule can be laid down to explain what is meant by the word solely A case somewhat similar to the present is Farmer v. Scottish North American Trust Ltd. (6) where it was held that interest paid on an overdraft required for purchasing shares (the shares purchased being retained as security for the overdraft) was an outgoing which could be deducted from the receipts to ascertain the taxable profits and gains Which were earned by them.  In our opinion, the present case falls within these principles. (1) 1937 I.T.R. 270 P.C. (2) 1937 I.T.R. 202 P.C. (3) 6 Tax Cases 501. (4) 1915 A.C. 433. (5) 1926 A.C. 205 at 221 and 235. (6) 1912 A.C. 118. One of the points which weighed with the Incometax Appellate Tribunal and the High Court was that though the conversion did not in any way disturb the holding of the investments of the company or interfere with the earning of its income, it had the effect of diminishing its taxable income. In our judgment, this is not a proper consideration when the transaction is not challenged on the ground of fraud. In the present case there is not even an allegation of fraud. The next point on which some stress was placed was that there was complete identity of person between the person whose shares were sold and the person who took the deben- tures and that the transaction resulted in considerable benefit to him. In the absence of a suggestion of fraud this is not relevant at all for giving effect to the provisions of section 12(2) of the Incometax Act.  Most commercial transactions are entered into for the mutual benefit of both sides, or at any rate each side hopes to gain something for itself. The test for present purposes is not whether the other party benefitted, nor indeed whether this was a pru- dent transaction which resulted in ultimate gain to the appellant, but whether it was properly entered into as apart of the appellants legitimate commercial undertakings in order indirectly to facilitate the carrying on of its busi- ness. The High Court doubted whether the transaction could be brought within the functions of an investment company and found it difficult to reconcile it with the objects set out in the Memorandum of Association. But we see no such diffi- culty.  Clause 5 empowers a reduction of capital of the company and clause 8(3) empowers the company to borrow or raise money by the issue of debentures. The matter is clear- ly writ in the bond. Moreover, we do not think that this inquiry is relevant, for we are dealing with a question of income-tax and not judging the legality or propriety of the transaction on an application to reduce the capital of the company.  The only question is whether this was done in the ordinary course of business for the purposes we have already pointed out, however mistaken the directors and shareholders of the company may have been. Therefore, as stated by the Income-tax Appellate Tribu- nal in its statement of the case, the executors of Lord Cables estate needed money. In the next place, the transac- tion was brought about at the instance of the holder of the majority of ordinary shares, and also that the shares were originally held by Lord Cable and his nominees. It seems evident therefore that Scott could have compelled the company to pay him cash for the shares.  He seems to have had the whip hand. Instead of doing that he entered into an arrangement which, while giving him the necessary facili- ties, appears to have satisfied the company by allowing it to retain its investments without a precipitate liquidation of a large portion thereof. It does not matter whether the company was right in this view or wrong, and in any event we are in no position to judge of the soundness of its decision because we have not all the materials before us. It has to be remembered that considerations of this kind go deeper than the apparent profit or loss on an isolated transaction standing by itself.  It is not enough to say that the 50,000 shares which were cancelled earned in the following year only 31/2 per cent. interest as against 5 per cent. on the debentures because we do not know to what extent the hold- ings of the company would have been disturbed if this had not been done. What we do know is what the Income-tax Appel- late Tribunal has stated, namely, that-- the change brought about had been so designed that the investments of the company were not to be disturbed and as a consequence the income accrued was in no way to be affected. This has only to be stated to show the commercial nature of the transaction from the companys point of view.  The High Court considered that the capital of the compa- ny could have been reduced in other ways. But that again is not the point. There are usually many ways in which a given thing can be brought about in business circles but it is not for the Court to decide which of them should have been employed when the Court is deciding a question under section 12(2) of the Income-tax Act. It was argued on behalf of the respondent (basing the same on paragraph 7 of the appellants application to the High Court dated 5th April, 1947) that the company had at the time sufficient liquid resources to effect the reduction of capital desired and so it was not necessary to resort to this process. But that again is not the point. The company chose to do it this way, and as there was not even a sugges- tion of fraud, the only question is whether it was gone through as an ordinary commercial proposition. But we doubt if that is what paragraph 7 meant because in paragraph 4 of the application to the High Court dated 11th February, 1944, the petitioner stated that the money on hand and at short notice was only Rs. 8,94,379. That is a good deal short of 50 lacs. However, we need not enter into this in detail. On a full review of the facts it is clear that this transaction was voluntarily entered into in order indirectly to facilitate the carrying on of the business of the company and was made on the ground of commercial expediency.  It therefore falls within the purview of section 12(2) of the Income-tax Act, 1922 before its amendment in 1939. This being an investment company, if it borrowed money and utilised the same for its investments on which it earned income, the interest paid by it on the loans will clearly be a permissible deduction under section 12(2) of the Income- tax Act. Whether the loan is taken on an overdraft, or is a fixed deposit or on a debenture makes no difference in law. The only argument urged against allowing this deduction to be made is that the person who took the debentures was the party who sold the ordinary shares.  It cannot be disputed that if the debentures were held by a third party, the interest payable on the same would be an allowable deduction in calculating the total income of the assessee company. What difference does it make if the holder of the debentures is a shareholder ? DECISION ??"

Appeal by special leave from the Judgment and Order dated 2nd August, 1951, of the High Court of Judicature at Nagpur in Miscellaneous Petition No. 187 of 1950 under arts. 226 and 227 of the Constitution. C. Chatterjee (R. M. Hajarnavis, with him) for the appellant. Ganapathy Iyer for the State of Madhya Pradesh. 1953. February 23. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by DAS J. On the 28th November, 1947, the appellant Hoosein Kasam Dada (India) Ltd., (hereinafter referred to as the assessee) submited to the Sales Tax Officer, Akola, a Sales Tax return in Form IV for the first quarter. Notice in Form XI calling upon the assessee to produce evidence in support of the said return having been issued by the Sales Tax Officer, the assessee produced his account books. Not being satisfied by the inspection of the account books as to the correctness of the return and being of opinion that the taxable turnover exceeded rupees two lacs the Sales Tax Officer submitted the case to the Assistant Commissioner of Sales Tax, Amravati, for assessment, On the 25th January, 1949, the Assistant Commissioner issued a fresh notice in Form XI under section 11 and fixed the case for disposal on the 5th February, 1949. After various adjournments and proceedings to which it is not necessary to refer, the hearing commenced on the 9th June, 1949, when an agent of the assessee appeared with books of account of the Akola Branch. Eventually after various further proceedings the Assistant Commissioner on the 8th April, 1950, assessed the assessee, to the best of his judgment, in the sum of Rs. 58,657140 and a copy of the order in Form XIV was sent to the assessee. Being aggrieved by the order of assessment the assessee on the 10th May, 1950, preferred an appeal to the Sales Tax Commissioner, Madhya Pradesh, under section 22(l) of the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act, 1947 (hereinafter referred to as the Act). The appeal not having been accompanied by any proof of the payment of the tax in respect of which the appeal had been preferred, the authorities, after giving the assessee several adjournments, declined to admit the appeal. The assessee moved the Board of Revenue, Madhya Pradesh, by a revision application against the order of the Sales Tax Commissioner contending that his appeal was not governed by the proviso to section 22(l) of the Act as amended on the 25th November, 1949, by the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax (Second Amendment) Act (Act LVII of 1949) but was governed by the proviso to section 22(l) of the Act as it stood when the assessment proceedings were started, i.e., before the said amendment. The Board of Revenue took the view that as the order of assessment was made after the amendment of the section and the appeal was filed thereafter such appeal must be governed by the provisions of law as it existed at the time the appeal was actually filed and that the law as it existed before the filing of the appeal could not apply to the case. The assessee thereupon moved the High Court of Madhya Pradesh under articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India praying, amongst other things, for a writ of mandamus or an appropriate order directing the Sales Tax Commissioner to admit and hear the appeal without demanding payment of the amount of sales tax assessed by the Assistant Commissioner of Sales Tax. The High Court dismissed the application on the 2nd August, 1951. The assessee applied to the High Court for leave to appeal to this Court which was also dismissed by the High Court on the 14th March, 1952. The assessee thereupon applied to this Court for special leave to appeal on the 12th May, 1952. This Court granted special leave to appeal, but such leave was, by the order granting such leave, limited to the question of the effect of the amendment to section 22 of the Act on the petitioners appeal to the Sales Tax Commissioner, Madhya Pradesh. This Court took the view that the other questions sought to be raised by the assessee would have to be decided by the Sales Tax Commissioner in case the appeal succeeded. The appeal has now come up for final disposal before us and in this appeal we are concerned only with the limited question of the effect of the amendment to section 22 of the Act. Section 22(l) of the Act was originally expressed in the following terms - 22. (1) Any dealer aggrieved by an order under this Act may, in the prescribed manner, appeal to the prescribed authority against the order Provided that no appeal against an order of assessment, with or without penalty, shall be entertained by the said authority unless it is satisfied that such amount of tax or penalty or both as the appellant may admit to be due from him, has been paid. The relevant portion of section 22 as amended runs as follows-- 22. (1) Any dealer aggrieved by an order under this Act may, in the prescribed manner, appeal to the prescribed authority against the order Provided that no appeal against an order of assessment, with or without penalty shall be admitted by the said authority unless such appeal is accompanied by a satisfactory proof of the payment of the tax, with penalty, if any, in respect of which the appeal has been preferred. It is clear from the language used in the proviso to section 22 (1) as it stood prior to the amendment that an aggrieved assessee had only to pay such amount of tax as he might admit to be due from him, whereas under the proviso to section 22(l) as amended the appeal has to be accompanied by satisfactory proof of payment of the tax in respect of which the appeal had been preferred. The contention of the present assessee is that as the amendment has not been made retrospective its right of appeal under the original section 22(l) remains unaffected and that accordingly as it does not admit anything to be due it was not liable to deposit any sum along with its appeal and the Commissioner was bound to admit its appeal and had no jurisdiction or power to reject it on the ground that it had not been accompanied by any proof of payment of the tax assessed against the appellant as required under the amended proviso and the Board of Revenue and the High Court were in error in not directing the Commissioner to admit the appeal. That the amendment has placed a substantial restriction on the assessees right of appeal cannot be disputed, for the amended section requires the payment of the entire assessed amount as a condition precedent to the admission of its appeal. The question is whether the imposition of such a restriction by amendment of the section can affect the assessees right of appeal from a decision in proceedings which commenced prior to such amendment and which right of appeal was free from such restriction under the section asit stood at the time of the commencement of the proceedings. The question was answered in the negative by the Judicial Committee in Colonial. Sugar Refining Co., Ltd. v. Irving(1). In that case the Collector of Customs acting under an Act called the Excise Tariff Act, 1902, required the appellants to pay pound 20,100 excise duty on 6,700 tons of sugar. The appellants disputed the claim. So they deposited L.R. 1905 A.C. 369. the money with the Collector and then brought the action by issuing a writ on the 25th October, 1902. A special case having been stated for the opinion of the Supreme Court, that Court on the 4th September, 1903, gave judgment for the Collector. In the meantime the Judiciary Act, 1903, was passed and received Royal assent on the 25th August, 1903, that is to say about 10 days before the judgment was delivered. By section 39(2) of that Act the right of appeal from the Supreme Court to the Privy Council given by the Order in Council of 1860 was taken away and the only appeal therefrom was directed to lie to the High Court of Australia. The appellants having with the leave of the Supreme Court filed an appeal to the Privy Council the respondents filed a petition taking the preliminary point that no appeal lay to the Privy Council and praying that the appeal be dismissed. in dismissing that application Lord Macnaghten who delivered the judgment of the Privy Council said- As regards the general principles applicable to the case there was no controversy. On the one hand, it was not disputed that if the matter in question be a matter of procedure only, the petition is well founded. On the other hand, if it be more than a matter of procedure, if it touches a right in existence at the passing of the Act,- it was conceded that, in accordance with a long line of authorities extending from the time of Lord Coke to the present day, the appellants would be entitled to succeed. The Judicary Act is not retrospective by express enactment or by necessary intendment. And therefore the only question is, was the appeal to His Majesty in Council a right vested in the appellants at the date of the passing of the Act, or was it a mere matter of procedure ? It seems to their Lordships that the question does not admit of doubt. To deprive a suitor in a pending action of an appeal to a superior tribunal which belonged to him as of right is a very different thing from regulating procedure. In princi- ple, their Lordships see no difference between abolishing an appeal altogether and transferring the appeal to a new tribunal. In either case there is an interference with existing rights contrary to the well-known general principle that statutes are not to be held to act retrospectively unless a clear intention to that effect is manifested. The principle of the above decision was applied by Jenkins  J. in Nana bin Aba v. Sheku bin Andu (1) and by the Privy Council itself in Delhi Cloth and General Mills Co. Ltd. v. Income-tax Commissioner, Delhi(). A Full Bench of the Lahore High Court adopted it in Kirpa Singh v. Rasaldar Ajaipal Singh (3). It was there regarded as settled that the right of appeal was not a mere matter of procedure but was a vested right which inhered in a party from the com mencement of the action in the Court of first instance and such right could not be taken away except by an express provision or by necessary implication. In Sardar Ali v. Dalimuddin (4), the suit out of which the appeal arose was filed in the Munsiff s Court at Alipore on the 7th October, 1920. The suit having been dismissed on the 17th July, 1924, the plaintiffs appealed to the Court of the District Judge but the appeal was dismissed. The plaintiffs then preferred a second appeal to the High Court on the 4th October, 1926.  That second appeal was heard by a Single Judge and was dismissed on the 4th April, 1928. In the meantime Clause 15 of the Letters Patent was amended on the 14th January 1928 so as to provide that no further appeal should lie from the decision of a Single Judge sitting in second appeal unless the Judge certified that the case was a fit one for appeal. In this case the learned Judge who dismissed the second appeal on the 4th April, 1928, declined to give any certificate of fitness. The plaintiffs on the 30th April, 1928, filed an appeal on the strength of clause 15 of the Letters Patent as it stood before the amendment. The contention of the appellants was that the amended clause could not be applied to that appeal, for to do so would be to apply it retrospectively and to impair and indeed to defeat a substantive right which was in existence (1) (1908) I.L.R. 32 Bom. 337. (3) A. I. R 1928 Lah. 627. (2) (1927) L.R. 54 I.A. 421 I.L.R. 9 Lah. 284. (4) (1929)  L.R. 56 Cal. 5I2. prior to the date of the amendment. The apppllants claimed that on the 7th October, 1920, when the suit was filed they had vested in them by the existing law a substantive right to a Letters Patent appeal from the decision of a Single Judge and that an intention to interfere with it, to clog it with a new condition or to impair or imperil it could not be presumed unless it was clearly manifested by express words or necessary intendment. In giving effect to the contentions of the appellants Rankin C.J. observed at p. 518- Now, the reasoning of the Judicial Committee in The Colonial Sugar Refining Companys case is a conclusive authority to show that rights of appeal are not matters of procedure, and that the right to enter the superior court is for the present purpose deemed to arise to a litigant before any decision has been given by the inferior court. If the latter proposition be accepted, I can see no intermediate point at which to resist the conclusion that the right arises at the date of the suit.  It was held that the new clause could not be given retrospective effect and accordingly the date of pre- sentation of the second appeal to the High Court was not the date which determined the applicability of the amended clause of the Letters Patent and that the date of the institution of the suit was the determining factor. As against the last mentioned decision of the Calcutta High Court Sri Ganapathy Aiyar, appearing for the respondent, refers us to the decision of a Bench of the Bombay High Court in the case of Badruddin Abdul Rahim v. Sitaram Vinayak Apte (1), where it was held that the amendment of clause 15 of the Letters Patent operated retrospectively. That case followed an earlier decision of the same High Court in Fram Bomanji v. Hormasji Barjorji (2). The decision in the old case proceeded upon two grounds, namely, (1) that the question was one of procedure and (2) that sec- (1) (1928) I.L R. 52 Bom. 753 A.I.R. (1928) Bom. 371. (2) (1866) Bom. H.C. (O.C.J.) 49. tion 2 of the New Letters Patent of 1865 gave retrospective operation to the Letters Patent by making it applicable to all pending suits. In so far as the first ground is concerned it clearly runs counter to the decision of the Privy Council in Colonial Sugar Refining Co. Ltd. v. Irving (supra) and must be taken as overruled as Fawcett J. himself acknowledged at page 756. As regards the second ground it is inapplicable to the case before us and it is not necessary to express any opinion as to the. soundness and validity of that ground. It may be mentioned here that in Shaikh Hasan Abdul Karim v. King Emperor (1) another Bench of the same High Court expressly dissented from the decision in Badruddin Abdul Rahim v. Sitaram Vinayak Apte (supra).  The principle laid down in the Colonial Sugar Refining Co.s case (supra) was followed by a Special Bench of Madras in In re Vasudeva Samiar (2). A Full Bench of the Allahabad High Court in Ram Singha v. Shankar Dayal (3) fell into line and held that the earlier decision on this point of that Court in Zamin Ali Khan v. Genda (4) stood overruled by the Privy Council decision in the Colonial Sugar Refining Co.s case. A Full Bench of Nagpur High Court in Radhakisan v. Shridar (5 ) has also taken the same view. The Punjab High Court has also adopted the same line in Gordhan Das v. The Governor General in Council (1). The case of Nagendra Nath Bose v. Mon Mohan Singha Roy (7) is indeed very much to the point. In that case the plaintiffs instituted a suit for rent valued at Rs. 1,30615 and obtained a decree. In execution of that decree the defaulting tenure was sold on the 20th November, 1928, for Rs. 1,600. On the 19th December, 1928, an application was made, under Order XXI, rule 90 of the Code of Civil Procedure, by the present petitioner, who was one of the judgment-debtors,  I.L.R (1945) Bom. 17. A I.R. (1929) Mad 381 56 M.L.J 369. (3) (1928) I.L.R. 50 All. 965 A.I.R. (1928) All. 437. (4) (1904) I.L.R. 26 All. 375. A.I.R. (1950) Nag. 177. A.I.R, (1952) Punjab 103 (F.B. ), (7) (1930) 34 C.W.N. 1009. for setting aside the sale. That. application having been dismissed for default of his appearance the petitioner preferred an appeal to the District Judge of Hoogly who refused to admit the appeal on the ground that the amount recoverable in execution of the decree had not been deposited as required by the proviso to section 174, clause (c), of the Bengal Tenancy Act as amended by an amending Act in 1928. The contention of the petitioner was that the amended provision which came into force on the 21st February, 1929, could not affect the right of appeal from a decision on an application made on the 19th December, 1928, for setting aside the sale. Mitter J. said at page 1011- We think the contention of the petitioner is wellfounded and must prevail.  That a right of appeal is a substantive right cannot now be seriously disputed. It is not a mere matter of procedure. Prior to the amendment of 1928 there was an appeal against an order refusing to set aside a sale (for that is the effect also where the application to set aside the sale is dismissed for default) under the provisions of Order 43, rule (1), of the Code of Civil Procedure. That right was unhampered by any restriction of the kind now imposed by section 174(5), Proviso. The Court was bound to admit the appeal whether appellant deposited the amount recoverable in execution of the decree or not. By requiring such deposit as a condition precedent to the admission of the appeal, a new restriction has been put on the right of appeal, the, admission of which is now hedged in with a condition. There can be no doubt that the right of appeal has been affected by the new provision and in the absence of an express enactment this amendment cannot apply to proceedings pending at the date when the new amendment came into force. It is true that the appeal was filed after the Act came into force, but that circumstance is immaterial--for the date to be looked into for this purpose is the date of the original proceeding which eventually culminated in the appeal. The, above decisions quite firmly establish and our decisions in Janardan Reddy v. The State (1) and in Ganpat Rai v. Agarwal Chamber of Commerce Ltd. (2) uphold the principle that a right of appeal is not merely a matter of procedure. It is matter of substantive right. This right of appeal from the decision of an .inferior tribunal to a superior tribunal becomes vested in a party when proceedings are first initiated in, and before a decision is given by, the inferior court.  In the language of Jenkins C.J. in Nana bin Aba v. Shaik bin Andu (supra) to disturb an existing right of appeal is not a mere alteration in procedure. Such a vested right cannot be taken away except by express enactment or necessary intendment. An intention to interfere with or to impair or imperil such a vested right cannot be presumed unless such intention be clearly manifested by express words or necessary implication. Sri Ganapathy Aiyar urges that the language of section 22(1) as amended clearly makes the section ret. rospective. The new proviso, it is pointed out, peremptorily requires the authority not to admit the appeal unless it be accompanied by a satisfactory proof of the payment of the tax in respect of which the appeal is preferred and this duty the authority must discharge at the time the appeal is actually preferred before him. The argument is that after the amendment the authority has no option in the matter and he has no jurisdiction to admit any appeal unless the assessed tax be deposited. It follows, therefore, by necessary implication, according to the learned Advocate, that the amended provision applies to an appeal from an assessment order made before the date of amendment as well as to an appeal from an order made after that date. A similar argument was urged before the Calcutta Special Bench in Sardar Ali v. Dalimuddin (supra), namely, that after the amendment the court had no authority to entertain an appeal without a certificate from the Single Judge. (1) 1950 S.C.R. 941. (2) (1952) S.C.J. 564. Rankin C.J. repelled this argument with the remark at page 520- Unless the contrary can be shown, the provision which takes away jurisdiction is itself subject to the implied saving of the litigants right.  In our view the above observation is apposite and applies to the case before us. The true implication of the above observation as of the decisions in the other cases referred to above is that the pre-existing right of appeal is not destroyed by the amendment if the amendment is not made retrospective by express words or necessary intendment. The fact that the pre-existing right of appeal continues to exist must, in its turn, necessarily imply that the old law which created that right of appeal must also exist to support the continuation of that right. As the old law continues to exist for the purpose of supporting the pre- existing right of appeal that old law must govern the exercise and enforcement of that right of appeal and there can then be no question of the amended provision preventing the exercise of that right. The argument that the authority has no option or jurisdiction to admit the appeal unless it be accompanied by the deposit of the assessed tax as required by the amended proviso to section 22(1) of the Act overlooks the fact of existence of the old law for the purpose of supporting the pre-existing right and really amounts to begging the question. The new proviso is wholly inapplicable in such a situation and the jurisdiction of the authority has to be exercised under the old law which so continues to exist. The argument of Sri Ganapathy lyer on this point, therefore, cannot be accepted. The learned Advocate urges that the requirment as to the deposit of the amount of the assessed costs does not affect the right of appeal itself which still remains intact, but only introduces a new matter of procedure.  He contends that this case is quite different from the case of Sardar Ali v. Dalmuddin (supra), for in this case it is entirely in the power of the appellant to deposit the tax if he chooses to do so whereas it was not within the power of the appellant in that case to secure a certificate from the learned Single Judge who disposed of the second appeal. In the first place the onerous condition may in a given case prevent the exercise of the right of appeal, for the assessee may not be in a position to find the necessary money in time. Further this argument cannot prevail in view of the decision of the Calcutta High Court in Nagendra Nath Bose v. Mon Mohan Singha (supra). No cogent argument has been adduced before us to show that that decision is not correct. There can be no doubt that the new requirement touches the substantive right of appeal vested in the appellant. Nor can it be overlooked that such a requirement is calculated to interfere with or fetter, if not to impair or imperil, the substantive right. The right that the amended section gives is certainly less than the right which was available before.  A provision which is calculated to deprive the appellant of the unfettered right of appeal cannot be regarded as a mere alteration in procedure. Indeed the new requirement cannot be said merely to regulate the exercise of the appellants pre-existing right but in truth whittles down the right itself and cannot be regarded as a mere rule of procedure. Finally, Sri Ganapathy lyer faintly urges that until actual assessment there can be no lis and, therefore, no right of appeal can accrue before that event. There are two answers to this plea. Whenever there is a proposition by one party and an opposition to that proposition by another a lis arises.  It may be conceded, though not deciding it, that when the assessee files his return a lis may not immediately arise, for under section 11 (1) the authority may accept the return as correct and complete. But if the authority is not satisfied as to the correctness of the return and calls for evidence, surely a controversy arises involving a proposition by the assessee and an opposition by the State. The circumstance that the authority who raises the dispute is himself the judge can make no difference, for the authority raises the dispute in the interest of the State and in so acting only represents the State.  It 1000 will appear from the dates given above that in this case the lis in the sense explained above arose before the date of amendment of the section. Further, even if the lis is to be taken as arising only on the date of assessment, there was a possibility of such a lis arising as soon as proceedings started with the filing of the return or, at any rate, when the authority called for evidence and started the hearing and the right of appeal must be taken to have been in existence even at those dates. For the purposes of the accrual of the right of appeal the critical and relevant date is the date of initiation of the proceedings and not the decision itself. DECISION ??"

The judgment of Patanjali Sastri C. J., Mukherjea and Ghulain Hasan JJ. was delivered by Patanjali Sastri C. J. Vivian Bose and Bhagwati JJ. delivered separate judgments. PATANJALI SASTRI C. J.-This is an appeal from the judgment and order of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay declaring the Bombay Sales Tax Act, 1952, (Act XXIV of 1952), ultra vires the State Legislature and issuing a writ in the nature of mandamus against the State of Bombay and the Collector of Sales Tax, Bombay, appellants herein, directing them to forbear and desist from enforcing the provisions of the said Act against the respondents who are dealers in motor cars in Bombay.  The Legislature of the State of Bombay enacted the Bombay Sales Tax Act, 1952, (hereinafter referred to as ,the Act) and it was brought into force on October 9, 1952, by notification issued under section 1 (3) of the Act, except sections 5, 9, 10 and 47 which came into operation on November 1, 1952, as notified under section 2 (3). On, the same day the rules made by the State Government in exercise of the power conferred by section 45 of the Act also came into force. 1075 On November 3, 1952, the respondents 1 to 6, who are companies incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913, and respondent No. 7, a partnership firm, all of whom are carrying on business in Bombay of buying and selling motor cars, presented a petition to the High Court under article 226 of the Constitution challenging the validity of the Act on the ground that it is ultra vires the State Legislature, inasmuch as it purported to tax sales arid purchases of goods regardless of the restrictions imposed on State legislative power by article 286 of the Constitution. It was also alleged that the provisions of the Act were discriminatory in their effect and, therefore, void under article 14 read with article 13 of the Constitution. The respondents accordingly prayed for the issue of a writ in the nature of mandamus against the appellants preventing them from enforcing the provisions of the Act against the respondents.  A further ground of attack was added by amendment of the petition to the effect that the Act being wholly ultra vires and void, the provisions requiring dealers to apply for registration in some cases and to obtain a licence in some others as a condition of carrying on their business, infringed the fundamental rights of the respondents under article 19 (1) (g) of the Constitution. In the affidavit filed in answer the appellants traversed the allegations in the petition and contended, inter alia, that the Act was a complete code and provided for special machinery for dealing with all questions arising under it, including questions of constitutionality, and, therefore, the petition was not maintainable, that the present ease was not an appropriate one for the issue of a writ under article 226 as the validity of the imposition of a tax was questioned, that no assessment proceedings having been initiated against the respondents and no demand notice having been issued, the respondents had no cause of action, and that, properly construed, the Act and the Rules did not contravene article 286 or any other provisions of the Constitution and did not infringe any fundamental right of the respondents, 1076 The petition was heard by a Division Bench of the High Court consisting of Chagla C. J. and Dixit J. Chagla C. J., who delivered the judgment, Dixit J. concurring, overruled the preliminary objection disdistinguishing the decisions cited in support thereof by pointing out that the principle that a court would not issue a prerogative writ when an adequate alternative remedy was available could not apply where, as here, a party came to the court with an allegation that his fundamental rights had been infringed and sought relief under article 226.  The learned Judges however thought, in view of the conclusion they had come to on the question of competency of the State Legislature to pass the Act, it was not necessary to consider the challenge that has been made to the Act under articles 14 and 19 and expressed no opinion on the alleged infringement of the respondents fundamental rights. On the merits, the learned Judges held that the definition of sale in the Act was so wide as to include the three categories of sale exempted by article 286 from the imposition of sales tax by the States, and, as the definition governed the charging sections 5 and 10, the Act must be taken to impose the tax on such sales also in contravention of article 286. The Act must, therefore, be declared wholly void, it being impossible to sever any specific offending provision so as to save the rest of the Act, as the definition pervades the whole Act and the whole scheme of the Act is bound up with the definition of sale. The learned Judges rejected the argument that the Act and the Rules must be read together to see whether the State has made a law imposing a tax in contravention of article 286, remarking that if the Act itself is bad,, the rules, made under it cannot have any greater efficacy. Nor was the Government, which was authorised to make rules for carrying out the purpose of the Act, under an obligation to exclude the exempted sales. The rules, too, did not exclude all the three categories of exempted sales but only two of them, and even such exclusion was hedged 1077 In view of the importance of the issues involved, notice of the appeal was issued to the AdvocatesGeneral of States under Order XLI, Rule 1, and many of them intervened and appeared before us. The Attorney-General of India, to whom notice was also sent, intervened on behalf of the Union of India. We have thus had the assistance of a full argument dealing with all aspects of the case.  The Advocate-General of Bombay, appearing on behalf of the appellants, took strong exception to the manner in which the learned Judges below disposed of the objection to the maintainability of the petition. He complained that, having entertained the petition on the ground that infringement of fundamental rights was alleged, and that the remedy under article 226 was, therefore, appropriate, the learned Judges issued a writ without finding that any fundamental right had in fact been infringed. Learned counsel for the State of West Bengal also represented that parties in that State frequently got petitions under article 226 admitted by alleging violation of some fundamental right, and the court sometimes issued the writ asked for without insisting on the allegation being substantiated. We are of opinion that it is always desirable, when relief under article 226 is sought on allegations of infringement of fundamental rights, that the court should satisfy itself that such allegations are well founded before proceeding further with the matter. In the present case, however, the appellants can have no grievance, as the respondents allegation of infringement of their fundamental right under article 19 (1) (g) was based on their contention that the Act was ultra vires the State Legislature, and that contention having been accepted, by the Court below, there would clearly be an unauthorised restriction on the respondents right to carry on their trade, registration and licence being required only to facilitate collection of the tax imposed.  As Mr. Seervai for the respondents rightly submitted, the fact that the Court below left the question undecided, though the point was concluded by the 1078 decision of this Court in Mohammad Yasin v. The Town Area Committee, Jalalbad (1), which was brought to the notice of the learned Judges, was not the fault of the respondents and gave no real cause for complaint. Before considering whether the appellant State has made a law imposing, or authorising the imposition of, a tax on sales or purchases of goods in disregard of constitutional restrictions on its legislative power in that behalf, it is necessary to ascertain the scope of such power and the nature and extent of the restrictions placed upon it by article 286. The power is conferred by article 246 (3) read with entry 54 of List 11 of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution. The Legislature of any State has, under these provisions, the exclusive power to make laws for such State or any part thereof with respect to taxes on the sale or purchase of goods other than newspapers. The expression for such State or any part thereof cannot, in our view, be taken to import into entry 54 the restriction that the sale or purchase referred to must take place within the territory of that State. All that it means is that the laws which a State is empowered to make must be for the purposes of that State.  As pointed out by the Privy Council in the Wallace Brothers case (2) in dealing with the competency of the Indian Legislature to impose tax on the income arising abroad to a non-resident foreign company, the constitutional validity of the relevant statutory provisions did not turn on the possession by the legislature of extra-territorial powers but on the existence of a sufficient territorial connection between the taxing State and what it seeks to tax. In the case of sales-tax it is not necessary that the sale or purchase should take place within the territorial limits of the State in the sense that all the ingredients of a sale like the agreement to sell, the passing of title, delivery of the goods, etc., should have a territorial connection with the State. Broadly speaking, local activities of buying or selling carried on in the State in relation to local goods would be a sufficient basis to sustain the taxing power of the State, provided of course, such (1) 1952 S.C.R. 572. (2) 1948 S.C.R. I 1079 activities ultimately resulted in a concluded sale or purchase to be taxed. In exercise of the legislative power conferred upon them in substantially similar terms by the Government of India Act, 1935, the Provincial Legislatures enacted sales-tax laws for their respective Provinces, acting on the principle of territorial nexus referred to above that is to say, they picked out one or more of the ingredients constituting a sale and made them the basis of their sales-tax legislation. Assam and Bengal made among other things the actual existence of the goods in the Province at the time of the contract of sale the test of taxability.  In Bihar the pro- duction or manufacture of the goods in the Province was made an additional ground. A net of the widest range perhaps was laid in Central Provinces and Bert where it was sufficient if the goods were actually found in the Province at any time after the contract of sale or purchase in respect thereof was made. Whether the territorial nexus put forward as the basis of the taxing power in each case would be sustained as sufficient was a matter of doubt not having been tested in a court of law. And such claims to taxing power led to multiple taxation of the same transaction by different Provinces and cumulation of the burden falling ultimately on the consuming public. This situation posed to the Constitution makers the problem of restricting the taxing power on sales or purchases involving inter-State elements, and alleviating the tax burden on the consumer. At the same time they were evidently anxious to maintain the State power of imposing non-discriminatory taxes on goods imported from other States, while upholding the economic unity of India by providing for the freedom of inter-State trade and commerce. In their attempt to harmonise and achieve these somewhat conflicting objectives they enacted articles 286, 301 an 304. These articles read as follows 286. (1) No law of a State shall impose, or authorise the imposition of, a tax on the sale or purchase of goods where such sale or purchase takes place- 1080 (a) outside the State or (b) in the course of the import of the goods into, nor export of the goods out of, the territory of India. Explanation.-For the purposes of sub-clause (a), a sale or purchase shall be deemed to have taken place in the State in which the goods have actually been delivered as a direct result of such sale or purchase for the purpose of consumption in that State, notwithstanding the fact that under the general law relating to sale of goods the property in the goods has by reason of such sale or purchase passed in another State. Except in so far as Parliament may by law otherwise provide, no law of a State shall impose, or authorise the imposition of, a tax on the sale or purchase of any goods where such sale or purchase takes place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce Provided that the President may by order direct that any tax on the sale or purchase of goods which was being lawfully levied by the Government of any State immediately before the commencement of this Constitution shall, notwithstanding that the imposition of such tax is contrary to the provisions of this clause, continue to be levied until the thirty-first day of March, 1951.  No law made by the Legislature of a State im- posing, or authorising the imposition of, a tax on the sale or purchase of any such goods as have been declared by Parliament by law to be essential for the life of the community shall have effect unless it has been reserved for the consideration of the President and has received his assent. 301, Subject to the other provisions of this Part, trade, commerce and intercourse throughout the territory of India shall be free. Notwithstanding anything in article 301 or article 303, the Legislature of a State may by law- (a) impose on goods imported from other States any tax to which similar goods manufactured or 1081 produced in that State are subject, so, however, as not to discriminate between goods so imported and goods,, so manufactured or produced and (b) impose such reasonable restrictions on the freedom of trade, commerce or intercourse with or within that State as may be required in the public interest Provided that no Bill or amendment for the purposes of clause (b) shall be introduced or moved in the Legislature of a State without the previous sanction of the President. It will be seen that the principle of freedom of inter- State trade and commerce declared in article 301 is expressly subordinated to the State power of taxing goods imported from sister States, provided only no discrimination is made in favour of similar goods of local origin. Thus the States in India have full power of imposing what in American State legislation is -called the use tax, gross receipts tax, etc. not to speak of the familiar property tax, subject only to the condition that such tax is imposed on all goods of the same kind produced or manufactured in the taxing State, although such taxation is undoubtedly calculated to fetter inter-State trade and commerce. In other words, the commercial unity of India is made to give way before the State-power of imposing any non-dis- criminatory tax on goods imported from sister States. Having thus provided for the freedom of inter-State trade and commerce subject to the important qualification mentioned above, the authors of the Constitution had to devise a formula of restrictions to be imposed on the State- power of taxing sales or purchases involving inter-State elements which would avoid the doubts and difficulties arising out of the imposition of sales-tax on the same transaction by several Provincial Legislatures in the country before the commencement of the Constitution. This they did by enacting clause (1) (a) with the Explanation and clause (2) of article 286. Clause (1) (a) prohibits the taxation of all sales or purchases which take place outside the State, 1082 but a localised sale is a troublesome concept, for, a sale is a composite transaction involving as it does several elements such as agreement to sell, transfer of ownership, payment of the price, delivery of the goods and. so forth, which may take place at different places. How, then, is it to be determined whether a particular sale or purchase took place within or outside the State ?  It is difficult to say that any one of the ingredients mentioned above is more essential to a sale or purchase than the others. To solve the difficulty an easily applicable test for determining what is an outside sale had to be formulated, and that is what, in our opinion, the Explanation was intended to do. It provides by means of a legal fiction that the State in which the goods sold or purchased are actually delivered for consumption therein is the State in which the sale or purchase is to be considered to have taken place, notwithstanding the property in such goods passed in another State. Why an outside sale or purchase is explained by defining what is an inside sale, and why actual delivery and consumption in the State are made the determining factors in locating a sale or purchase will presently appear. The test of sufficient territorial nexus was thus replaced by a simpler and more easily workable test Are the goods actually delivered in the taxing State, as a direct result of a sale or purchase, for the purpose of consumption therein ? Then, such sale or purchase shall be deemed to have taken place in that State and outside all other States. The latter States are prohibited from taxing the sale or purchase the former alone is left free to do so. Multiple taxation of the same transaction by different States is also thus avoided. It is, however, argued on behalf of Bombay that the Explanation does not say that the State of delivery is the only State in which the sale or purchase shall be deemed to have taken place.  If that was the intention, it would have been easy to say so. On the other hand, the non-obstante clause in the Explanation is said to indicate that, apart from cases covered by the legal fiction, the passing of property in the goods is to determine the place of sale. Thus, both the State of delivery 1083 and the State in which the property in the goods sold passes are, it is claimed, empowered to tax. We are unable to accept this view. It is really not necessary in the context to use the word only in the way suggested, for, when the Explanation says that a sale or purchase shall be deemed to have taken place in a particular State, it follows that it shall be deemed also to have taken place outside the other States. Nor can the non-obstante clause be understood as implying that, under the general law relating to the sale of goods, the passing of the property in the goods is the determining factor in locating a sale or purchase. Neither the Sale of Goods Act nor the common law relating to the sale of goods has anything to say as to what the situs of a sale is, though certain rules have been laid down for ascertaining the intention of the contracting parties as to when or under what conditions the property in the goods is to pass to the buyer.  That question often raises ticklish problems for lawyers and courts, and to make the passing of title the determining factor in the location of a sale or purchase would be to replace old uncertainties and difficulties connected with the nexus basis with new ones. Nor would the hardship of multiple taxation be obviated if two States were still free to impose tax on the same tran- saction. In our opinion, the non-obstante clause was inserted in the Explanation simply with a view to make it clear beyond all possible doubt that it was immaterial where the property in the goods passed, as it might otherwise be regarded as indicative of the place of sale. It is also to be noted in this connection that, on the construction suggested by the Advocate-General of Bombay, namely, that the Explanation was not intended to deprive the State in which the property in the goods passed of its taxing power, but only to exclude the sales or purchases of the kind described in the Explanation from the operation of clause (1) (a) which prohibits taxation of outside sales or purchases, the Explanation would operate, not as an explanation, but as an exception or a proviso to that clause. It 1084 may be that the description of a provision cannot be decisive of its true meaning or interpretation which must depend on the words used therein, but, when two interpretations are sought to be put upon a provision, that which fits the description which the legislature has chosen to apply to it is, according to sound canons of construction, to be adopted provided, of course, it is consistent with the language employed, in preference to the one which attributes to the provision a different effect from what it should have according to its description by the legislature.  It was then said that the formula of delivery for consumption within a State could only cover the com- paratively few cases of sales or purchases taking place directly between the consumers in the delivery State and dealers in other States, and inter-State sales or purchases between dealers in either State, which must be larger in number and volume, would still be outside the scope of the Explanation, which could not, therefore, have been intended to empower only one State, namely, the delivery State, to tax all inter-State sales or purchases. We see no force in this objection. It is to be noted that the Explanation does not say that the consumption should be by the purchaser himself. Nor do the words as a direct result have reference to consumption. They qualify actual delivery .  The expression for the purpose of consumption in that State must, in our opinion, be understood as having reference not merely to the individual importer or purchaser but as contemplating distribution eventually to consumers in general within the State. Thus all buyers within the State of delivery from out-of-State sellers, except those buying for re-export out of the State, would be within the scope of-the Explanation and liable to be taxed by the State on their inter-State transactions. It should be remembered here that the Explanation deals only with interState sales. or purchases and not with purely local or domestic transactions. That these are subject to the taxing power of the State has never been questioned. We are therefore of opinion that article 286 (1) (a) read with the Explanation prohibits taxation of sales 1085 or purchases involving inter-State elements by all States except the State in which the goods are delivered for the purpose of consumption therein in the wider sense explained above. The latter State is left free to tax such sales or purchases, which power it derives not by virtue of the Explanation but under article 246 (3) read with entry 54 of List II. We will now consider the effect of article 286(2) on the taxability of inter-State sales or purchases of the kind envisaged by the Explanation to clause (1) (a). As both the Explanation and clause (2) deal only with inter-State transactions, it may appear at first blush that whatever taxing power the Explanation may have reserved to the state of delivery is nullified by clause (2), at any rate until Parliament chooses to lift the ban under the power reserved to it by the opening words of clause (2). As one way of avoiding this result I it was suggested by the Advocate- Gneral of Bombay that the expression inter-State trade and commerce in clause (2) may be construed as meaning dealings between a trader in one State and a trader in another, so that the clause would be applicable only to sales or purchases in the course of dealings between such traders. The ban under clause (2) could not in that view, affect the taxability of a sale by a trader in one State to a consumer or user in another. We cannot agree with this restrictive interpretation of the expression inter-State trade and commerce. The sale by a trader in one State to a user in another would be a sale in the course of inter-State trade according to the natural meaning of those words, and we can see no reason for importing the restriction that the transaction should be one between two traders only.  This is, however, not to say that the ban under clause (2) extends to the taxing power which the delivery State is left free, under the Explanation, to exercise. We are of opinion that the operation of clause (2) stands excluded as a result of the legal fiction enacted in the explanation, and the State in which the goods are actually delivered for consumption can impose tax on inter-State sales or purchases. The effect of the 1086 Explanation in regard to inter-State dealings is, in our view, to invest what, in truth, is an inter-State transac- tion with an intrastate character in relation to the State of delivery, and clause (2) can, therefore, have no application. It is true that the legal fiction is to operate for the purposes of sub-clause (a) of clause (1), but that means merely that the Explanation is designed to explain the meaning of the expression outside the State in clause (1) (a). When once, however, it is determined with the aid of the fictional test that a particular sale or purchase has taken place within the taxing State, it follows, as a corollary, that the transaction loses its inter-State character and falls outside the purview of clause (2), not because the definition in the Explanation is used for the purpose of clause (2), but because such sale or purchase becomes in the eye of the law a purely local transaction.  It is said that even though all the essential ingredients of a sale took place within one State and the sale was, in that sense, a purely intrastate transaction, it might involve transport of the goods across the State- boundary, and that would be sufficient to bring it within the scope of clause (2). We find it difficult to appreciate this argument. As already stated, the Explanation envisages sales or purchases under which out-of-State goods are imported into the State. That is the essential element which makes such a transaction inter-State in character, and if it is turned into an intrastate transaction by the operation of the legal fiction which blots out from view the inter-State element , it is not logical to say that the transaction, though now become local and domestic in the eye of the law, still retains its inter-State character. The statutory fiction completely masks the inter-State character of the sale or purchase which, as a collateral result of such making, falls outside the scope of clause (2). It is said that, on this view, clause (2) would become practically redundant, as clause (1) (a) read with the explanation as construed by us would itself preclude taxation by other States of inter-State sales or purchases of the kind referred to in the explanation. As 1087 We have already pointed out, the Explanation does not cover cases of inter-State sales or purchases under which the goods are imported into the State for reexport to other States and possibly other categories of sales or purchases which do not satisfy all the requirements of the explanation. Whether such transactions are sufficiently numerous for the Constitution to take note of is a matter of opinion and it cannot have much bearing on the question of construction.  On the other hand there are, in our judgment, cogent considerations which tend to support the view we have expressed above that clause (2) was not intended to affect the power of the delivery State to tax inter-State sales or purchases of the kind mentioned in the Explanation. As we have seen, in our Constitution the principle of freedom of inter-State trade and commerce is made to give way before the State-power of imposing non-discriminatory taxes on goods imported from other States. Now, article 286(2) is but one phase of the protection accorded to interState trade and commerce from the fettering power of State taxation.  As article 286 deals with restrictions on the power of the States to impose tax on the sale or purchase of goods, the Constitution makers evidently thought that it should contain also a specific provision safeguarding sales or purchases of an inter-State character against the taxing power of the States. It is however, reasonable to suppose that this particular form of protection to inter-State trade and commerce provided in article 286(2) was not intended to have a wider operation than what is contemplated in Part XIII which declares the general principle of freedom of inter-State commerce and defines the measure of constitutional protection it should enjoy. If such protection is intended to give way before the State-power of taxing goods imported from sister States, subject only to the condition against discrimination, it is legitimate to suppose that the ban under article 286(2) should not operate so as to nullify that power. True, article 304 (a) deals with the restrictions as to imposition of tax on goods, while article 1088 deals with the restrictions as to imposition of tax on sales or purchases of goods. But this distinc tion loses its practical importance in the case of sales-tax imposed by the delivery State under the conditions mentioned in the Explanation, for, if we look behind the labels at the substance of the matter, it becomes clear that a tax on sales or purchases imposed by the State in which the goods are delivered for consumption, in the sense already explained, is, in economic effect practically indistinguishable from a tax on the consumption or use of the goods. The words in which the goods have actually been delivered ensure that the goods have come into the State, and the expression for the purpose of consumption in the State shows that, though the tax is formally laid on sales, its incidence is aimed at the consumers in the State. Discussing the true nature of a duty of excise and a tax on the sale of goods, Gwyer C. J. observed in the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax case (1) It is common ground that the Court is entitled to look at the real substance of the Act imposing it, at what it does and not merely at what it says, in order to ascertain the true nature of the tax. Since writers on political economy are agreed that taxes on the sale of commodities are simply taxes on the commodities themselves, it is possible to regard a tax on the retail sale of motor spirit -and lubricants as a tax on those commodities. Therefore, sales-tax, the incidence of which is really directed against the consumer, is, in substance, a tax on the goods imposed, no doubt, on the occasion of the sale as a taxable event.  It will now be seen why the Explanation insists on actual delivery of the goods in the State and their consumption in the State, and why an outside sale or purchase is explained by defining what is an inside sale. The object clearly is to assimilate the conditions, under which the delivery State is left free to tax inter-State sales or purchases, to those under which a State is empowered to impose tax on goods imported into the State from other States under article 304 (a). If then, a non-discriminatory use or consumption tax imposed under (1) 1939 F.C.R. 18, 42. 1089 article 304 on goods imported from other States does not infringe the freedom of inter-State commerce declared by article 301, parity of reason and policy requires that a tax on sales or purchases imposed by the State in which the goods are actually delivered for consumption in the State should not be regarded as violative of the ban under article 286 (2), and that is what the statutory fiction enacted in the Explanation was, in our judgment, designed to achieve by divesting the sale or purchase of the kind referred. to in the Explanation of its inter-State"
124.0,Tax,"Bose, J. This is an appeal by an assessee against a judgment and order of the High Court at Bombay delivered on a reference made by the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal. The Bombay High Court refused leave to appeal but the assessee obtained special leave from this Court. The appellant deals in silver and shares and a substantial part of his holding is kept in silver bullion and shares. His business is run and owned by himself. His accounts are maintained according to the mercantile system. It is admitted that under this system stocks can be valued in one of two ways and provided there is no variation in the method from year to year without the sanction of the Income-tax authorities an assessee can choose whichever method, that is to say, the cost price of the stock was wnterred at the beginning of the year and not its market value and similarly the cost price was again entered at the close of the year of any stock which was not disposed of during the yeaar. The entries on the one side of the accounts at the beginning of the year thus balance those on the other in respect of these items with the result that so far as they are concerned the books show neither a profit nor a loss on them. This was the method regularly employed and it is admitted on all hands that this was permissible under this system of accounting. The accounting year with which we are concerned is the calendar year 1942. The silver bars and shares lying with the appellant at the beginning of the year were valued at cost price. In the course of the year the appellant withdrew some bars and shares from the business and settled them on certain trusts, three in number. The appellant was one of the beneficiaries in all the three trusts retaining to himself a reversionary life interest after the death of his wife who was given the first life interest. After certain other life interests the ultimate beneficiaries were charities. The appellant was the managing trustee expressly so created in two of the trusts and virtually so in the third. In this books the appellant credited the business with the cost price of the bars and shares so withdrawn and there lies the crux of the issue which we have to determine. There is no suggestion in this case that the bars and shares were withdrawn from the business otherwise than in good faith. According to the appellant, the act of withdrawl resulted in neither income nor profit nor gain either to himself or to his business, nor was it a business transcation, accordingly it was not taxable. The learned Attorney-General raised two contentions. First, he said that as the bars and shares were brought into the business any withdrawl of them from the business must be dealt with along ordinary and well-known business lines, namely, that if a person withdraws an asset from a business he must account for it to the business at the marlet rate prevailing at the date of the withdrawl. He said that the mere fact that the appellant was the sole owner of the business can make no difference, for under the Act income is assessable under distinct heads and when we are working out the income of a business the rules applicable to business incomes must be applied whoever is the owner. His second contention was that if the act of withdrawl is at a time when the market price is higher than the cost price, then the State is deprived of a potential profit. He conceded that had the market rate been lower than the cost price, then the appellant would have been entitled to set off the loss on those transactions against his overall profit on the other transcations and thus obtain the advantage of a lower tax on the overall picture. We are of opinion that the learned Attorney-Generals secound contention is unsound because, for income-tax purposes, each year is a self contained accounting period and we can only take into consideration income, profits and gains made in that year and are not concerned with potential profits which may be made in another year any more than we are with losses which may occur in the future. As regards the first contention, we are of opinion that the appellant was right in entering the cost value of the silver and shares at the date of the withdrawl, because it was not a business transcation and by that act the business made no profit or gain, nor did it sustain a loss, and the appellant derived no immediate pecuniary gain the State cannot tax them, for under the Income-tax Act the State has no power to tax a potential future advantage. All it acn tax is income, profits and gains made in the relevant accounting year. It was conceded that if these assets had been sold at cost price the State could have claimed nothing, for a man cannot be compelled to make a profit out of any particular transcation. It was also conceded that if the silver and stocks had lain where they were, then again there would have been no advantage to the State because the appellant would have been entitled to enter their closing vlaues at cost at the end of the year. The learned Attorney-General even conceded that if they had been sold at a loss the appellant would have been entitled to set that off agianst his other gains, but he said that is because all those are business transactions and that is the way the law deals with such matters when they occur in the ordinary course of business. But, he urged, when there is a withdrawl and no sale or its equivalent, the matter is different. As this is a business, any wihtdrawl of the assets is a business matter and the only feasible way of regarding it in a business light is to enter the market price at the date of the withdrawl and whether that happens to favour the assessee or the State is immaterial. We do not agree. It is well recognised that in revenue cases regard must be had to the substance of the transaction rather than to tis mere form. In the present case disregarding technicalities it is impossible to get away from the fact that the business is owned and run by the assessee himself. In a such circumstances we are of opinion that it is wholly unreal and artificial to separate the business from its owner and treat them as if they were separate entities trading with each other and then by means of a fictional sale introduce a fictional profit which in truth and in fact is non-existent. Cut away the fictions and you reach the position that the man is supposed to be selling to himself and thereby making a profit out of himself which on the lace of it is not only absurd but against all canons of mercantile and income-tax law. And worse. He may keep it and not show a profit. He may sell it to another at a loss and cannot be taxed because he cannot be compelled to sell at a fictional profit when the market rises in order that he may be compelled to pay to Government a tax which is anything but fictional. Consider this simple illustration. A man trades in rice and also uses rice for his family consumption. the bags are all stored in one godown and he draws upon his stock as and when he finds it necessary to do so, now for his business, now for his own use. what he keeps for his own personal use cannot be taxed however much the market rises nor can he be taxed on what he gives away from his own personal stock, nor, so far as his shop is concerned, can he be compelled to sell at a profit. If he keeps two sets of books and enters in one all the bags which go into his personal godown and in the other the rice which is withdrawn from the godown into his customers so that only a negligible quantity is left over in the shop after each days sales, his private and personal dealings with the bags in his personal godown could not be taxed unless he sells them at a profit. What he chooses to do with the rice in his godown is no concern of the Income-tax department provided always that he does not sell it or otherwise make a profit out of it. He can consume it, or give it away, or just left it rot. why should it make a difference if instead of keeping two sets of books he keeps only one ? How cah he be said to have made an income personally or his business a profit, because he uses ten bags out of his godown for a feast for the marriage of his daughter? How can it make any difference whether the bags are shifted directly from the godown to the kitchen or from the godown to the shop and from the shop to the kitchen? And yet, when the reasoning of the learned Attorney- General is pushed to tis logical conclusion, the form of the transcation is of its essence and its taxable or not according to the route the rice takes from the godown to the wedding feast. In our opinion, it would make no difference if the man instead of giving the feast himself hands over the rice to his daughter as a gift for the marriage festivities of her son. The appellants mehtod of book-keeping reflects the true position. As he makes his purchases he enters his stock at the cost price on one side of the accounts. At the close of the year he enters the value of any unsold stock at cost on the other side of the accounts thus cancelling out the entries relating to the same unsold stock earlier in the accounts and then that is carried forward as the opening balance in the next years accounts. This cancelling out of the unsold stock from both sides of the accounts leaves only the transactions on which there have been actual sales and gives the true and actual profits or loss on his years dealings. In the same way, the appellant has reflected the true state of his finances and given a truthful picture of the profit and loss in his business by entering the bullion and silver at cost when he withdrew them for a purely non-business purpose and utilised them in a transaction which brought him neither income nor profit nor gain. There is no case quite in point. The learned Attorney-General relied on Gold Coast Selection Trust Limited v. Humphrey (H. M. Inspector of Taxes) (1949) 30 Tax Cas. 209 17 ITR Suppl. 19, but there the assessee received a new and valuable asset in exchange for another in the ordianry course of his trade. It was held that he was bound to account for the receipt was not money it was capable of being valued in terms of money. In the present case, the assessees business received nothing in exchange for the withdrawl of the assets, neither money nor moneys worth, therefore the only fair way of treating the matter was to do just what the appellant did, namely to enter the price at which the assets were valued at the beginning of the year so that the entries would cancel each other out and level the business with neither a gain or a loss on those transcations. The learned Attorney-General contended that if that was allowed great loss would ensue to the State because all a man need do at the end of the year would be to withdraw all assets which had risen in value and leave only those which had depreciated and thus either show a loss or reduce his taxable profits. This arguments can only prevail on the assumption that the State can tax potential profits because, except for that, the State would neither gain nor loss in a case of this kind. Had the assets been left where they were, they would have been valued at the end of the year as they were at the beginning, at the cost price and we would be a gain at some future indefinite date is mere guess work, for equal there might be loss. Apart, however, from that the learned Attorney- Generals rule is equally capable of abuse. A man could as easily withdrawn from the business assets which had depreciated and enter in his books the deprecated market value and leave at cost price the assets which had risen. There are two cases which bear a superficial resemblance to this case. They are In the matter of Messrs. Chouthmal Golapchand (1938 6 ITR 733). and In re Spanish Prospecting company Limited (1911 I ch 92). We refrain from expressing any opinion about them, especially as they appear to reach different conclusions, the facts are not the same and the questions which arose on the facts there were not argued here. they raise matters of wider arose on the facts there were not argued here. They raise matters of wider import which will require consideration in s suitable case. These cases were not cases of a business owned and run by a single owner and so the fiction of treating the business as a separate entity from its owner actually trading with him, which we are asked to apply here, does not arise. In the next place, the business there were not continuing as here. In the Calcutta case, a partnership was wound up and the question related to the valuation of assets consisting of stocks and shares, on the dissolution. In the English case, a company with no fixed capital was under liquidation and the question was whether the market value of certain debentures which the company had purchased ought to be brought into the profit and loss account so as to augment the profits actually shown in the balance-sheet. the company wished to treat those debentures as of no value and thus show a much smaller profit than would otherwise have been the case. On the answer to that question hung the fate of two servants of the company who, under the terms of their agreement with the company, could only be paid their salaries out of the profits of the company. Neither case is in our opinion, apposite here. The question referred were -  Whether in the circumstances of the case any income arose to the assessee as a result of the transfer of hsres and silver bars to the trustees? If the answer to question (I) is in afirmative, whether the method employed by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and upheld by the Appellate Tribunal in computing the assessees income from the transfer is the proper method for computing the income? Our answer to the first question is that in the circumstances of this case no income arose to the appellant as a result of the transfer of the shares and silver bars to the trustees. In view of that, the second question does not arise. The appeal is allowed with costs. Bhagwati, J. This appeal by special leave from a judgment of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay on a reference by the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal under Section 66 (I) of the Indian Income-tax Act (XI of 1922) raises an interesting question as to the valuation of an asset withdrawn from the stock-in-trade of a running business. The assessee was in the year of account (calendar year 1942) a dealer in shares and silver. On the 21st January, 1942, he withdrew from the business certain shares and silver bars and executed two deeds of trust and on the 19th October, 1942, he withdrew further shares and silver bars and executed a third deed of trust. The terms and conditions of the deeds of trust are not material for the purpose of this appeal. The assessee kept his books of account on the mercantile basis and the method employed by him in the past for valuing the closing stock of his stock-in-trade was valuation at the cost price thereof. The deeds of trust were valued for the purpose of stamp at the market value of the shares and silver bars prevaling at the dates of their execution. The assessee however showed the transfer of these shares and silver bars to trustees in the books of account at the cost price thereof thus setting off the debit shown in respect of the same at the beginning of the year of account. He contended that the market value of the said shares and silver bars on which the stamp duty was based could not be basis for computing his income from stock-in-trade thus transferred. The Income-tax authorities did not accept this contention and assessed the profit at the difference between the cost price of the said shares and silver bars and the market value thereof at the date of their withdrawal from the business. the Income-tax Officer, the Appellate Assistant Commissioner as also the income-tax Appellate Tribunal rejected this contention of the assessee and the income-tax Appellate tribunal submitted at the instance of the assessee a case under Section 66 (I) of the Act referring the following two questions for the decision of the High Court -  Wether in the circumstances of the case any income arose to the petitioner as a result of the transfer of shares and silver bars to the trustees? If the answer to the question (I) is in the affirmative, wether the method employed by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and upheld by the Appellate Tribunal in computing the petitioners income from the transfer is the purpose method for computing the income? The High Court answered both the question in the affirmative. It was not disputed before the Income-tax Act Appellate Tribunal that the shares transferred were the stock-in-trade of the business. As regards the silver bars the Tribunal found that the assessee had been making purchases and sales frequently and that the silver also was stock-in-trade and not a capital investment. Both the shares and the silver bars were thus part of the stock-in-trade of the business. they had been purchased by the assessee from time to time and formed part of the stock-intrade of the business and had been shown at the cost price thereof in the books of account of the previous years and also at the opening of the year of account. If the shares and the silver bars which were thus withdrawn from the stock-in-trade at the closing of the year of account, the value of these shares and silver bars would also have been shown at the cost price in accordance with the system of accounts maintained by the assessee. The question however which falls to be determined is what is the effect of these assets having been withdrawn from the stock-in- trade of the business. So far as the business itself is concerned the asset which has been brought in is of a particular value at the date when it has been so brought in and it is then valued in the books of account at its cost. In the course of the business however the asset appreciates or depreciates in value in accordance with the fluctuations of the market. If the cost price basis is adopted for the valuation of stock- in-trade at the close of the year this appreciation or depreciation in the value as the case may be would not be reflected in the accounts.  If however the market valued at the market value basis is adopted for such valuation, the asset on being valued at the market rate thereof at the close of the year might show a loss and this loss would be allowed by the Income-tax authorities in computing the profit or loss of the business. In either event, the assessee would have to carry over the asset in the books of account of the subsequent year at the valuation adopted at the close of the previous year and the valuation adopted at the close of the previous year and the assessee would not be allowed to change the basis valuation thus adopted unless he close to adopt at the end of the subsequent year or years valuation at the cost price thus realised and the profit or loss as the case may be, in regard to that asset and that profit or loss would be allowed by the Income-tax authorities in the computation of profit or loss of valuation would not however make any difference in the ultimate reslu. On the cost price basis of valuation all intermediate fluctuation of price during the interval between the bringing of the asset in the business and the realisation of it would be eliminated and the only thing considered in the accounts would be the difference and the price of the asset when it was brought into the business and the price thereof when the asset as at the close of every the fluctuation in the market value of the asset as at the close of every year of account a rectification would have to be made in the result of the trading of the previous year which was not correctly reflected in the accounts by reason of the assessee having adopted the market value obtaining at the close of the previous year as the value of the asset. This process of rectification would continue from year to year until the asset was realised on the sale of the asset would be brought into account in that year. the ultimate result of these operations so fas as the asset itself is concerned would be no different.  Because if regard be had to the various fluctuations in the market value which have been reflected in the accounts of the intermediate period, what the business actually realised. The only advantage which the assessee obtains would be that he would be able to anticipate in a particular year the loss that may be made on the asset in the following year or years if the prices rose again. Is there any difference in the position when instead of the asset being realised it is withdrawn from the stock-intrade of the business? So far as the business is concerned the asset ceases to be a aprt of the stock-in-trade whether it is realised or is withdrawn from the stock-in-trade. the asset after it has been brought into the business appreciates or depreciates in value in accordance with the fluctuations of the market and that appreciated or depreciated asset continues to be a part of the stock-in-trade of the business until it is realised or withdrawn. This appreciation or depreciation in value is not reflected for the valuation of the stock-in-trade at the close of theyear of account, but is certainly reflected as above indicated in the books of account when the market value basis is adopted. In each case however the actual profit or loss to the business as the case may ne in relation to the price at which the asset was brought into the business would be determined at the date when the asset is realised. That would be the measure of the appreciation or depreciation in value of the asset which till then formed a aprt of the stock-in-trade of the business, and would also be the measure of the ultimate profit or loss as the case may be of the business in regard to that particular asset. When the asset is withdrawn from the stock-in-trade of the business the position in my opinion would be no different. So far as the business is concerned the asset would go out and cease to be a aprt of its stock-in-trade and this again would be the measure of the profit or loss as the case may be of the business qua that particular asset. To my mind it makes not the slightest difference whether an asset is realised in the course of the business or withdrawn from the stock-in-trade of the business. An asset which has appreciated or depreciated in value as the case may be in accordance with the fluctuation of the market ceases to be a aprt of the business, by the one process or the other. So far as the business is concerned it is entitled to credit in its goods account the price of that asset as ahs been realised by the sale thereof or the market value of that asset as at the date of its withdrawal. Looking at the matter from the assessees point of view also, it does not make any the slightest difference whether he realises the asset in the course of the business and utilises it in any manner he chooses. Having brought into the business an asset which was of a particular value at that time, he withdraws from the business that asset at time when it has appreciated or depreciated in value. The business would be entitled to the appreciation or depreciation in value of that asset in so far as the asset had become a part of the stock-in-trade of the business. When the asset is withdrawn by the assessee, the assessee obtains in his hands by reason of such withdrawal an asset which at the time of the withdrawal has appreciated or depreciated in values as the case may be in comparison with its vlaue at the time when it was brought into the business and the assessee on such withdrawal would be able to deal with or dispose of an asset which had thus appreciated or depreciated in value.  In my opinion the manner of his dealing with the asset after he withdraws it from the stock-in-trade of the business is really immmaterial. What is material from the stock-in-trade of the business and that vlaue can only be determine by the market value of the asset as at the date of its withdrawal. It was urged that the withdrawal of the asset from the stock-in-trade of the business was not a business operation and that an entry on the credit side crediting the cost price of the particular asset would therefore be enough. This argument however does not take into account the appreciation or the deprciation in the value of the asset on the date of the withdrawal as compared to its value when it was intially brought into business. It also doesnot take into account the fact that the assessee might have adopted the market value basis for valuation of stock-in-trade on hand at the close of the previous year or years of account. The entry on the debit side at the beginning of the year of account would not then represent the cost price of the asset but would represent the market valu of the asset at the close of previous year account. What would then be the rational basis on which the credit entry should be made at the date of withdrawal? Should it be the cost price of the asset which was not at all reflected in the accounts except at the intial stage when the asset was brought into the business or the market value of the asset when it was withdrawn? surely the method of account keeping cannot make any differences to actual position, whether an asset has apperciated or depreciated in value and what pofit or loss if any accrued to the business when tje asset was withdrawn from the stock-in-trade of the business. There is also a further fact to be considered and it is that when the asset is withdrawn from the stock-in-trade of the business there would be of necessity an entry in the account of the person withdrawing it debiting the price of that asset to him. If the assessee withdraws from the stock-in-trade of the business an asset which has thus appreciated or depreciated in value is there any justification whatever for debiting him with the cost price of that asset and not the market value of the asset as at the date of withdrawal? In the event of the asset having appreciated in value the assessee should be debited in his account with the appreciated market value of the asset inasmuch as he withdraws from the stock-in-trade of the business an asset has depreciated in value the assessee should certainly not be mulcted. He withdraws from the stock-in-trade of the business an asset which is of a depreciated value as compared with its value when it was brought inhto the business and he should not certainly be debited with a higher price even though it may be the cost price as appearing in the books of account according to the particular system of accounting adopted by the assessee. I am therefore definitely of the opinion that even in the case of withdrawal as in the case of the realisation of the asset the business is entitled to credit the goods account the market value of the asset as at the date of its withdrawl whatever be the method adopted by it for valuation of its stock-in-trade on hand at the close of a year of account. Shri R. J. Kolah appearing for the appellant particularly relied upon a decision of the Calcutta High Court, In the matter of Messrs.  Chouthmal Golapchand constituted by four partners with equal shares, and they had at the beginning of the accounting year 1935-36 an opening stock of shares valued at cost price of Rs. 85,331. On the 8th January, 1936, the partners resolved to dissolve the firm with effect from the 30th March, 1936, and in view of the pending dissolution they divided amongst themselves on the 9th March, 1936, there shares which were then valued at the rates prevailing in the market at an aggregate sum of Rs. 51,966. There was a difference was claimed by the assessees as a loss in the assessment. This claim of the assessees was negatived on the ground that there was nothing to show that loss had occurred in the year of account. The assessees having adopted the system of valuing the shares at cost price at the end of every year and the opening of the next year, the cost price of shares was taken to have been their value at the beginning of the year of account and the partition was taken as not amounting to a sale of the shares with the result that there was no evidence of any loss. With great respect to the learned Judges I do not see my way to agree with the reasoning of this judgment does not take count of the fact that at the date of the partition the assets which had been brought into the business at the earlier dates had depreciated in value and it was these depreciated assets which were the subject-matter of partition between the partners. Even if the partition be not treated as a sale it was a transer of property, the property of the firm being transferred to the individual partners thereof and each partner obtaining an absolute interest in the shares thus transferred to him by the firm was concerned it was certainly a transfer of the property to the individual partners and even as regards the partners themselves it was transfer of the interests of the partners inter se in the shares respectively transferred absolutely to each of them. If it were necessary to do so I would certainly say that the case was erroneously decided. (See also the judgment of Fletcher Moulton L. J. in In re Spanish Prospecting Co., Ltd. (1911 1 Ch. 92 at p. 98.)) DECISION ??"
125.0,Tax,"Mahajan, J. This is appeal from the Judgment of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay delivered on a reference under Section 66(1) of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922, whereby the High Court answered the first referred question in the negative. The assessment in question concern the year 1943-44. A Hindu undivided family was carrying on business in Bombay, Madras and the Mysore State. Its business was taken over by a registered firm on March 17, 1942. For the purpose of this appeal however this circumstance is not material. The case has been dealt with on the assumption that a single assessee carried on business from October 10, 1948, to November 8, 1942, the relevant accounting year. According to the accounts of the assessee, during this period the Mysore branch purchased goods from the Bombay head office and the Madras branch of the value of Rs. 2,45,455. The Income-tax Officer estimated these purchases of the Mysore branch in British India at Rs. 3,00,000 and its profits at Rs. 75,000 on the sale of these goods in Mysore. In view of the provisions of Section 42 of the Act half of this profit, i.e., to the extent of Rs. 37,500, was deemed to accrue or a rise in British India, because of the business connection of the non-resident branch in British India. It was contended that the assessee being a person resident in India, Section 42 could not be invoked in the case, because that section had application only to cases of non-resident. The Income-tax Tribunal following the decision of the Bombay High Court in Commissioner of Income-tax v. Western India Life Assurance Co., Ltd., upheld this contention, and ruled that no part of the Mysore profit could be taxed in British India. At the instance of the Commissioner of Income-tax Excess Profits Tax, Bombay City, three question were referred to the High Court under Section 66(1), the first of these being - Whether in the circumstances of the case can the profits on the sale of goods in the Mysore State be deemed to accrue or arise in British India under Section 42(1) of the India Income-tax Act. The High Court returned an answer to the question in the negative after resettling it in these terms - Whether on the facts and the circumstances of the case the Income-tax Officer was right in applying the provision of Section 42(1) of the Income-tax Act and holding that Rs. 37,500 were profits deemed to accrue in British India and in including in the assessment a portion thereof. This appeal is before us on a certificate granted by the High Court and the only question canvassed here is whether Section 42(1) of the India Income-tax Act has application to the case of a resident assessee or whether its scope be limited to non-resident assessee alone. It is common ground that if Section 42 of the Act has no application to the case of a resident assessee the whole of the Mysore profit, namely Rs. 75,000 cannot be included in the assessment of the year 1943-44. On the other hand, if such an assessee is within the ambit of the section, in that event the sum R s. 37,500 or any part of it would be liable to assessment during the assessment year in question. Section 42 of the Act is in these terms -  All income, profits or gains accruing or arising, whether directly or indirectly, through or from any business connection in the taxable territories, or through or from any property in the taxable territories, or through or from any asset or source of income in the taxable territories, or through or from any money lent at interest and brought into the taxable territories in cash or in kind or through or from the sale, exchange or transfer of a capital asset in the taxable territories, shall be deemed to be income accruing or arising within the taxable territories, and were the person entitled to the income, profits or gains is not resident in the taxable territories, shall be chargeable to income-tax either in his name or in the name of his agent and in the latter case such agent shall be deemed to be, for all the purposes of this Act, the assessee in respect of such income-tax  Provided that where the person entitle to the income, profits or gains is not resident in the taxable territories, the income-tax so chargeable nay be recovered by deduction under any of the provisions of Section 18 and that any arrears of tax may be recovered also in accordance with the provision of this Act from any assets of the non- resident person which are, or may at any time come within the taxable territories  Provided further that any such agent, or any person who apprehends that he may be assessed as such an agent, may retain out of any money payable by him to such non-resident person a sum equal to his estimated liability under this sub-section, and in the event of any disagreement between the non-resident person and such agent or person as to the amount to be so retained, such agent or person may secure from the Income-tax Officer a certificate stating the amount to be so retained pending final settlement of the certificate so obtained shall be his warrant for retaining that amount  Provided further that the amount recoverable from such agent or person at the time of final settlement shall not exceed the amount specified in such certificate except to the extent to which such agent or person may at such time have in his hands additional assets of such non- resident person. Where a person not resident or not ordinarily resident in the taxable territories carries on business with a person resident in the taxable territories, and it appears to the Income-tax Officer, that owing to the close connection between such persons the course of business is so arranged that the business done by the resident person with the person not resident or not ordinarily resident produces to the resident either no profits or less than the ordinary profits which might be expected to arise in that business, the profits derived therefrom or which may reasonably be deemed to have been derived therefrom, shall be chargeable to income-tax in the purposes of this Act, the assessee in respect of such income-tax.  In the case of a business of which all the operations are not carried out in the taxable territories the profits and gains of the business deemed under this section to accrue or arise in the taxable territories shall be only such profits and gains as are reasonably attributable to that part of the operations carried out in the taxable territories. Before its amendment in the year 1939 the first part of the section ran thus - 42. (1) In the case of any person residing out of British India, all profits or gains accruing or arising to such person, whether directly or indirectly, through or from any business connection or property in British India, shall be deemed to be income accruing or arising within British India, and shall be chargeable to income-tax in the name of the agent of any such person, and such agent shall be deemed to be, for all the purposes of this Act, the assessee in respect of such income- tax . The rest of the section was substantially in the same termes. In spite of its amendment in 1939 the marginal note to the section continued to refer to non-resident as before, though the words residing out of British India were deleted from the body of sub-section (1). The retention of this marginal note gave rise to conflicting decision on the question whether the section in spite of the chang made in its language in 1939 still continued to have application to cases of non- resident alone. In order to clarify this matter, by Act XXII of 1947 the magical note was amended and it now is in these terms - Income deemed to accrue or arise within British India. It is significant that the changes made in Section 42 in the year 1939 were consequential to the entire recasting of Section 4 of the Act. Section 4 as it stood prior to 1939 charged income-tax on all income, profits or gains, from whatever source derived, accruing or arising, or received in British India or deemed under the provisions of the Act to accrue, or arise, or to be received in British India. It further provided that the income, profits and gains accruing or arising without British India to a person resident in British India shall, if they are received in or brought into British India, be deemed to have accrued or arisen in British India and to be income, profits and gains of the year in which they are so received or brought, notwithstanding the fact that they did not so accrued or arise in that year. By the amendment in the year 1939, the total income of any previous year of any person was defined as including all income, profits and gains from whatever source derived which  (a) are received or are deemed to be received in British India in such year by or on behalf of such person, or (b) if such person is resident in British India during such year, -  accrue or arise or are deemed to accrue or arise to him in British India during such year or accrue or arise to him without British India during such year or  (c) if such person in sot resident in British India during such year, accrue or arise or are deemed to accrue or arise to him in British India during such year  This legislative change in the Act made all income accruing or arising or deemed to accrue or arise in British India during the previous year to a resident the subject to charge, apart from income accruing or arising without British India during the previous year. The term deemed brings within the net of chargeability income not actually accruing but which is supposed nationally to have accrued. It involves a number of concepts. By statutory fiction income which can in no sense be said to accrue at all may be considered as so accruing. Similarly, the fiction may relate to the place, the person or be in respect of the year of taxability. Section 42(1) defines what income is deemed to accrue within the taxable territories. It is only by application of this definition that one class of income deemed to accrue to a resident within the taxable territories within the meaning of Section 4(1)(b)(i) can be estimated. The words In the case of any person residing out of British India were deleted from Section 42(1) during the tendency of the amendment bill of 1939 in the Council of State presumably with the object of making the section application to any person who had any income which in a primary sense arose in British India, even though technically it had arisen abroad, irrespective of the circumstance whether that person was resident, ordinarily resident or not ordinarily resident. By Section 8 of Act XXIII of 1941, clause (c) was added to Section 14 of the Act. No effect was to be given to this amendment before the year ending March 31, 1943. The relevant part of Section 14 after this amendment is in these terms - The tax shall not be payable by an assessee in respect of any income, profits or gains accruing or arising to him within a Part B State, unless such income, profits or gains are received or deemed to be received in or are brought into the taxable territories in the previous year by or on behalf of the assessee, or are assessable under Section 12-B or Section 42. In view of these legislative changes in the provisions of Section 4, 14 and 42 of the Act, the conclusion is irresistible that the object or recasting Section 42(1) in general terms was to make the definition of deemed income given in the section generally applicable to all classes of assessees. This sub-section has been drafted in the widest terms and there is nothing whatsoever in its language to suggest that its operation is confined to non-residents only. Wherever the legislature intended to limit the operation of any part of this section to non-residents alone, it said so in express terms. Sub- section (2) and the latter portion of sub-section (1) expressly concern themselves with the case of non-residents, while sub-section (1) and (3) are so framed that they cover both residents and non- residents. A Bench to the Bombay High Court in Commissioner of Income-tax v. Western India Life Insurance Co., held that notwithstanding its amendment in 1939 the section applied only to non-residents. Reliance was placed, inter alia, on the circumstance that the marginal note appended to the section indicating that it applied to non-resident alone, had not been deleted. To avoid this criticism and to remove doubts the legislature by Act XXIII of 1947 changed the marginal note also. It seems to us that any other construction of the section would create an anomaly, inasmuch as the Part B State income falling under Section 42 would not be assessable in the hands of a resident, but it would be assessable in the hands of a non-resident, because the Income-tax Act, while it ropes in world income of a resident exempts income accruing within the Part B States from its ambit, except when such income is received or is brought into taxable territory or comes within the ambit of Section 42. Such a construction would be contrary to the policy of the Act. It is unnecessary to dwell on this point at any great length in view of the circumstance that the decision in Commissioner of Income-tax v. Western India Life Insurance Co., has been dissented from and for good reasons, in subsequent cases. In Sutlej Cotton Mills Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income-tax, West Bengal, a Bench of the Calcutta High Court considered this matter at some length and reached the decision the sub-sections (1) and (3) of Section 42 covered cases of both residents as well as non-residents. The same view was taken by a Bench of the Madras v. P arasuram Jethanand. Again the matter was discussed in this court in Commissioner of Income-tax, Bombay v. Ahmedbhai Umarbhai Co., by Patanjali Sastri, J., as he then was, and also by Mukherjea, J., in the same case. This is what Patanjali Sastri, J., said on this point - It is noteworthy that the first part of sub-section (1) of Section 42 providing that certain classes of income are to be deemed to accrue or arise in British India is not confined in its application to non- residents, but is in general terms so as to be applicable to both residents and non-residents. Before its amendment in 1939 the sub- section began with the words in the case of any person residing out of British India which obviously restricted the application of the provision to non-resident persons, but in its amended form the sub- section has been recast into two distinct parts, the first of which is not so restricted, and the second part alone, which begins with the words and where the person entitled to the income, profits and gains is not resident in British India, is made applicable to non-resident persons, thereby showing that the former part applies to both residents and non-residents. The opening words of the first proviso also point to the same conclusion, for these words would be supplusage it the sub-section as a whole applied only to non-residents.  A contrary view has, no doubt, been expressed by a Division Bench of the Bombay High Court in Commissioner of Income-tax v. Western India Life Insurance Co., Ltd. Though reference was made in that case to the alteration in the structure of sub-section (I) its significance, as it seems to me, was not properly appreciated. The facts that the marginal note to the whole section refers to non-residents and that the section itself finds a place in Chapter V headed Liability in special cases were relied upon as supporting the view that sub-section (I) as a whole applies only to non-residents. As pointed out by the Privy Council in Balraj Kunwar v. Jagatpal Singh, marginal notes in an Indian statute, as in an Act of Parliament, cannot be referred to for the purpose of construing the statute, and it may be mentioned in this connection that the marginal note relied on has since been replaced by the words Income deemed to accrue or arise within British India which makes it clear that the main object of sub-section (I) was to define that expression see Section 12(a) of Act XXII of 1947. Nor can the title of a chapter be legitimately used to restrict the plain terms of an enactment.  The same view was expressed by Mukherjea, J. Nothing that has been said by Mr. Kolah before us justifies reconsideration of these opinions. Mr. Kolah argued that when the world income of a resident was brought within the net of chargeability by Section 4 in 1939 it was then wholly unnecessary to include such an assessee in the ambit of Section 42. In our judgment, this contention is fallacious. Whatever income arises in a primary sense to a resident in the taxable territories is chargeable under Section 4(1)(b)(i). Hence it was necessary to make Section 42 applicable to such a case. Whatever other consideration may arise in estimating the foreign income of a resident will not be applicable to income deemed to accrue within the taxable territory. Moreover, as above pointed out, in view of the provisions of Section 14(2)(c), resident assessees, but for Section 42(1), would not be liable to assessment regarding income accruing to them in Part B States, even if there is a business connection in the taxable territory.  Mr. Kolan was unable to suggest any reasonable explanation for the deletion of the words any person residing out of British India from Section 42(1) as it stood before 1939. The only purpose in deleting these words could be to bring residents within the ambit of the section. There is no reason whatsoever for not giving to the palin words of the section the meaning that on the face of it they bear. For the reasons given above we are of the opinion that the answer re turned by the High Court of Bombay to the first question referred to it was wrong. DECISION ??"
126.0,Tax,"The facts of the case have been stated with sufficient fulness, yet briefly, in the statement of the case submitted by the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal (Calcutta Bench) and may be conveniently set out in its own words (1) 1955 27 I.T.R. 202. The applicant had received sums of Rs. 3,831, Rs. 6,606, Rs. 7,954 and Rs. 8,304 in the four assessment years, 1944- 45, 1945-46, 1946-47 and 1947-48 as income from dividends. The shares in respect of which this dividend income was received were the property of the Applicant but in the books of the various companies these stood in the names of other persons. It appears that these shares were purchased by the Applicant from other persons under a blank transfer but the transfers had not been registered with the various companies. The Applicants claim in these income-tax proceedings was that these shares although not registered in the name of the applicant were the property of the applicant. It was further claimed that this dividend income should be grossed up under s. 16(2) and credit for the tax deducted should be allowed to the Applicant under s. 18(5). The Income-tax Officer did not accept this claim, and the appeals of the assessee were rejected by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner of Income-tax, Calcutta, A Range and by the Appellate Tribunal. The Tribunal, however, on being moved, referred the following question to the High Court Whether in the facts and circumstances of this case, the Applicant (the assessee) was entitled to have this dividend income grossed up under section 16(2) and claim credit for tax deducted at source under section 18(5) of the Income-tax Act? The High Court answered the question in the negative, thus affirming the decisions of the Department and the Appellate Tribunal. The assessee contends that the decision of the High Court is erroneous, and that it is entitled to have the dividend income I grossed up under s. 16(2) and also to claim credit for tax deducted at source, under s.18(5) of the Income-tax Act. The relevant sections are as follows 16(2) For the purposes of inclusion in the total income of an assessee any dividend shall be deemed to be income of the previous year in which it is paid, credited or distributed or deemed to have been paid, credited or distributed to him, and shall be increased to such amount as would, if income-tax (but not super-tax) at the rate applicable to the total income of the company without taking into account any rebate allowed or additional income-tax charged for the financial year in which the dividend is paid, credited or distributed or deemed to have been paid, credited or distributed, were deducted therefrom, be equal to the amount of the dividend (proviso omitted). 18 (5) Any deduction made and paid to the account of the Central Government in accordance with the provisions of this section and any sum by which a dividend has been increased under sub-section (2) of section 16 shall be treated as a payment of incometax or super-tax on behalf of the shareholder and credit shall be given to him therefor on the production of the certificate furnished undersection 20 in the assessment, if any, made for the following year under this Act (proviso omitted). 49B(1) Where any dividend has been paid, credited or distributed or is deemed to have been paid, credited or distributed to any of the persons specified in section 3 who is a shareholder of a company which is assessed to income- tax in the taxable territories or elsewhere, such person shall, if the dividend is included in his total income, be deemed in respect of such dividend himself to have paid income-tax (exclusive of super-tax) of an amount equal to the sum by which the dividend has been increased under sub- section (2) of section 16. It was contended in the High Court that inasmuch as s. 16(2) referred to an I assessee, the assessee company was entitled to have the dividend grossed up by the addition of income- tax paid by the various companies at source and consequently to have the benefit of the credit allowed under the two remaining sections. In the opinion of the High Court, an assessee whose name was not in the register of members of the companies was not entitled to the benefit of these provisions. The learned Judges of the High Court were of the opinion that the word shareholder in s.18(5) had the same signification as the word member used in the Indian Companies Act and that the assessee was not qualified to be considered as a shareholder, even though by a blank transfer it had ,purchased the relevant shares. In our opinion, the High Court was right in its conclusion. A company when it pays income-tax, does not do so on behalf of the shareholders. It is itself chargeable under the Act, In Cull v. Inland Revenue Commissioners (1), Lord Atkin stated the law (which in substance is also the law in our country) thus My Lords, it is now clearly established that in the case of a limited company the company itself is chargeable to tax on its profits, and that it pays tax in discharge of its own liability and not as agent for its shareholders At one time it was thought that the company, in paying tax, paid on behalf of the shareholder but this theory is now exploded by decisions in this House, and the position of the shareholders as to tax is as I have stated it. When the company pays its own income-tax and declares a dividend from the balance of its profits, it deducts from such dividend a proportionate part of the amount of the tax paid by it. This principle is explained in another English case, and it is substantially also the law in this country. In Inland Revenue Commissioners v. Blott (2), Viscount Cave stated the law in these words Plainly, a company paying income-tax on its profits does not pay it as agent for its shareholders. It pays as a tax- payer, and if no dividend is declared, the shareholders have no direct concern in the payment. If a dividend is declared, -the company is entitled to deduct from such dividend a proportionate part of the amount of the tax previously paid by the company and, in that case, the payment by the company operates in relief of the shareholder. But no agency, properly so called, is involved. The share-holders, however, get the benefit of the payment of the tax by the company. Though under (1) 1940 A.C. 51, 56 (1939) 22 Tax Cas. 603, 636. (2) 1921 2 A.C. 171, 201. s.16(2) of the Act their dividend is increased by a proportionate amount of tax paid by the company, the payment of the tax by the company is deemed tinder ss. 18(5) and 49B(1) to be payment by the shareholders. The rates of income-tax applicable to the company are, in most instances, higher than the rates applicable to the individual shareholders, and by this process of grossing up, as it is commonly called, the recipient of the dividend gets some benefit. The position of a shareholder who gets dividend when his name stands in the register of members of the company causes no difficulty whatever. But transfers of shares are common, and they take place either by a fully executed document such as was contemplated by Regulation 18 of Table A of the Indian Companies Act 1913, or by what are known as blank transfers. In such blank transfers, the name of the transferor is entered, and the transfer deed signed by the transferor is handed over with the share scrip to the trans- feree, who, if he so chooses, completes the transfer by entering his name and then applying to the company to register his name in place of the previous holder of the share. The company recognises no person except one whose name is on the register of members, upon whom alone calls for unpaid capital can be made and to whom only the dividend declared by the company is legally payable. Of course, between the transferor and the transferee, certain equities arise even on the execution and handing over of a blank transfer, and among these equities is the right of the transferee to claim the dividend declared and paid to the transferor who is treated as a trustee on behalf of the transferee. These equities, however, do not touch the company, and no claim by the transferee whose name is not in the register of members can be made against the company, if the tranferor retains the money in his own hands and fails to pay it to him. A glance at the scheme of the Indian Companies Act, 1913, shows that the words member , shareholder and holder of a share have been used interchangeably in that Act. Indeed, the opinion of most of the writers on the subject is also the same. Buckley on the Companies Act, 12th Edition, page 803 has pointed out that the right of a transferee is only to call upon the company to register his name and no more.- No rights arise till such registration ,takes place. Section 2(16) of the Indian Companies Act, 1913, defines share as share in the share capital of the company Section 5 deals with the mode of forming incorporated companies, and in the case of companies limited by shares, the liability of the members is limited to the amounts, if any, unpaid on the shares respectively held by them. By s. 18, Table A is made applicable to companies, unless by the Articles of any company the terms of Table A have been excluded or modified. Regulation 18 of Table A reads as follows The instrument of transfer of any share in the company shall be executed both by the transferor and transferee, and the transferor shall be deemed to remain holder of the share until the name of the transferee is entered in the register of members in respect thereof. The words holder of a share are really equal to the word shareholder and the expression holder of a share denotes, in so far as the company is concerned, only a person who, as a shareholder, has his name entered on the register of members. A similar view of the Companies Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, was taken in Nanney v. Morgan(1). The learned Lord Justices held that under s. 15 of that Act, the transferee bad not the benefit of a legal title till certain things were done, which were indicated by Lopes, J., in the following passage Therefore the transferor, until the delivery of the deed of transfer to the secretary, is subject to all the liabilities and entitled to all the rights which belong to a shareholder or stockholder, and, in my opinion until the requisite formalities are complied with, he continues the legal -proprietor of the stock or shares subject to that proprietorship being divested, which it may be at any moment, by a compliance with the requisite formalities. (1) (1888) 37 Ch. D. 346, 356. The same position obtains in India, though the completion of the transaction by having the name entered in the register of members relates it back to the time when the transfer was first made. See Nagabushanam v. Ramachandra Rao (1). During the period that the transfer exists between the transferor and the transferee without emerging as a binding document upon the company, equities exist between them, but not between the transferee and the company. The transferee can call upon the transferor to attend the meeting, vote according to his directions, sign documents in relation to the issuance of fresh capital, call for emergent meetings and inter alia, also compel the transferor to pay such dividend as he may have received. See E. D. Sassoon Co. Ltd. v. Patch-(2) approved in Mathalone v. Bombay Life Assurance Co. Ltd. (3 ). But these rights though they, no doubt, clothe the transferee with an equitable ownership-, are not sufficient to make the transferee a full owner, since the legal interest vis-a-vis the company still outstands in the transferor so much so, that the company credits the dividends only to the transferor and also calls upon him to make payment of any unpaid capital, which may be needed. The cases in Black v. Homersham (4) or Wimbush, In re Richards v. Wimbush (5) hardly advance the matter further than this. The position, therefore, under the Indian Com- panies Act, 1913, is quite clear that the expression shareholder or holder of a share in so far as that Act is concerned, denotes no other person except a member . The question that arises in the present case is whether by reason of ss. 16(2) and 18(5) the assessee, who was a transferee on a blank transfer is entitled to the benefits of the grossing up of the dividend income. Learned counsel for the assessee strenuously contends that the assessee being an owner in equity of the shares and thus also of the dividend is entitled to this benefit. He refers to the use of the word I assessee in s. 16(2). The Department, on the (1) (1922) I.L.R. 45 Mad. 537. (3) 1954 S.C.R. 117. (2) (1922) 45 Bom. L.R. 46. (4) (1878-79) L. R. 4 Ex. D. 24. (5) 1940 1 Ch. D. 92. other hand, says that the dividend can be increased under s. 16(2) and credit allowed under s. 18(5) if the assessee is a shareholder, because the benefit of s. 18(5) can go only to the shareholder, i. e., a person with his name on the register of members, and not to a person holding an equity against such shareholder. The assessee contends that the word shareholder includes even a person who holds a share as a result of a blank transfer, and does not necessarily mean a member of the company, whose name is on the register of members. Authorities on this point are not wanting, and indeed, in the judgment of the Calcutta High Court they have all been referred to. They are all against the assessee. See Shree Shakti Mills Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income-tax (1), Jaluram Bhikulal v. Commissioner of Income-tax (2), Arvind N. Mafatlal v. Incometax Officer (3) and Bikaner Trading Co. v. Commissioner of Income-tax (4). The question that falls for consideration is whether the meaning given to the expression shareholder used in s. 18(5) of the Act by these cases is correct. No valid reason exists why shareholder as used in s. 18(5) should mean a person other than the one denoted by the same expression in the Indian Companies Act, 1913. In In re Wala Wynaad Indian Gold Mining Company (5), Chitty, J., observed I use now myself the term which is common in the Courts, I a shareholder, that means the holder of the shares. It is the common term used, and only means the person who holds the shares by having his name on the register. Learned counsel for the assessee cited a number of authorities in which the ownership of the dividend was in question, and it was held that the transferee whose name was not registered, was entitled to the dividend after transfer had been made. These cases are Commissioners of Inland Revenue v. Sir John Oakley (6), Spence v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue (7) (1) 1948 16 I.T.R. 187. (3) 1957 32 I.T.R. 350. (5) (1882) 21 Ch. D. 849, 854. (2) 1952 22 I.T.R. 490. (4) 1953 24 I.T.R. 419. (6) (1925) 9 Tax Cas. 582, (7) (1941) 24 Tax Cas. 311. and others cited at page 367 in Multipar Syndicate, Ltd. v. Devitt (1). No one can doubt the correctness of the proposition in these cases, but from an equitable right to compel the transferor to give up the dividend to the transferee, to a claim to the dividend by him as a shareholder against the company is a wide jump. In so far as the company is concerned, it does not even issue the certificate under s. 20 of the Income-tax Act in the name of an unregistered transferee but only in the name of the transferor whom it recognises, because his name is borne on its books. Section 20 lays down The principal officer of every company shall, at the time of distribution of dividends, furnish to every person receiving a dividend a certificate to the effect that the company has paid or will pay income-tax on the profits which are being distributed, and specifying such other particulars as may be prescribed. The meaning of s. 20 as also of s. 18(5) is clear if they are read with s. 19A, under which information regarding dividends has to be supplied by the company when demanded by the Income-tax Officer. It lays down The principal officer of every company shall, on or before the 15th day of June in each year, furnish to the prescribed officer a return in the prescribed form and verified in the prescribed manner of the names and of the addresses, as entered in the register of shareholders maintained by the company, of the shareholders to whom a dividend or aggregate dividends exceeding Such amount as may be prescribed in this behalf has or have been, distributed during the, preceding year and of the amount so distributed to each such shareholder. (Italics supplied). Section 19A makes it clear, if any doubt existed, that by the term shareholder is meant the person whose name and address are entered in the register of shareholders maintained by the company. There is but one register maintained by the Company. There (1) (1945) 26 Tax Cas. 359. is no separate register of shareholders such as the assessee claims to be but only a register of members . This takes us immediately to the register of members, and demonstrates that even for the purpose of the Indian Income- tax Act, the words ,member and shareholder can be read as synonymous. The words of s. 18(5) must accordingly be read in the light in which the word shareholder has been used in the subsequent sections, and read in that manner, the present assessee, notwithstanding the equitable right to the dividend, was not entitled to be regarded as a shareholder for the purpose of s. 18(5) of the Act.DECISION ??"
127.0,Tax,"The respondents at all material times were non-residents carrying on business at Secunderabad which was then in the territories of the Nizam of Hyderabad. They acted as agents for the supply of gas plants manufactured by Messrs. T. V. S. Iyengar Sons, Madura, to the Nizams Government, and also as agents of the Lucas Indian Services, Bombay branch, for the supply of certain goods to that Government. The year of assessment is 1945-46. There does not appear to have been any written agreement between the two manufacturers and the respondents but the goods were to be supplied on a commission basis. In pursuance of this agreement the respondents received from M s. T.V.S. lyengar Sons, Madura, cheques drawn on the Imperial Bank of India, Madras, amounting to Rs. 35,202 in respect of all goods supplied from -Madura and also from Lucas Indian Services, Bombay, by cheques drawn on Imperial Bank of India, Bombay branch, amounting to Rs. 5,302 in respect of goods supplied by them, thus making a total of Rs. 40,504. These cheques were sent by post and when received by the respondents at Secunderabad were credited in the account books of the respondents and sent to their banker G. Raghunathmal for collecting and crediting to the account of the respondents. As against these sums so deposited the respondents at once drew cheques and thus operated on these amounts deposited. In regard to the commission received from the Bombay firm it was paid into the account on December 22, 1944, but was given credit for only on January 2, 1945. The Income-tax Officer assessed these sums as taxable income holding that the entire amount of Rs. 40,504 was received in British India and not at Secunderabad. An appeal was taken by the respondents to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner who upheld the order holding that income must be held to have accrued, arisen or received in British India. Against this order the respondents took an appeal to the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal and it was held that the amounts were received by the respondents from Madura and Bombay firms as commission but they were received at Secunderabad. The appeal was therefore allowed. The finding Of the Appellate Tribunal in their own words was- The contention of the Appellants is that the cheques being negotiable instruments and the creditor having accepted them and passed through their books, II the receipt must be taken to be receipts in Hyderabad. We agree with the view submitted by the appellants. In Bhashyams Negotiable Instruments Act, 8th Edition, Revised, page 556, it is stated that it will be open to a creditor to accept a cheque in absolute payment of money due to him, in which case it will be equivalent to cash payment. That being the position it cannot be said that the income was received in British India . At the instance of the Commissioner a reference under s. 66(1) of the Act was made to the High Court of Orissa for their opinion on the following question - Whether in the circumstances of the case, the sums of Rs. 35,202 and Rs. 5,302 received as commission from T. V. S. lyengar Sons Ltd., and Lucas Indian Services Ltd., respectively were income that accrued, arose or were received in British India . The High Court found that the statement of case was imperfect and that the real question was different. It said The real question in all such cases is not merely whether the cheques were drawn on a bank in British India, and sent for collection to that bank. The question is whether when the cheques were received by the assessee having his place of business outside British India, those cheques were in fact received as absolute and final payments by way of unconditional discharge or whether they were received as mere conditional payments on realisation. The fact that cheques were drawn on a bank in British India or that they were sent for collection through a Secunderabad banker of the assessee though relevant, are not conclusive . It therefore remitted the case to the Appellate Tribunal for submission of supplementary statement of case. It appears that at that stage the controversy was confined to the question whether the cheques having been sent to Secunderabad and having been realised in British India would amount to a final discharge or an unconditional one. The Tribunal in its supplementary statement found that the course of conduct followed by the parties showed that the cheques were received from the Bombay and Madura firms in full satisfaction of the commission ascertained from time to time and due on such date. It said The facts that such entries were made in the assessees books, that the cheques were put into the bank immediately, that the bank at once gave credit to the assessee for these sums after charging discount thereon and immediately allowed the assessee to operate on those sums are significant . Therefore the finding of fact by the Tribunal although not specific was that the receipt of the cheque by the respondents operated as full discharge of the debt due on account of commission from these two firms. The matter was decided by the High Court against the appellant and in the meanwhile this Court had given a judgment in Commissioner of Income-tax v. Ogale Glass Works Ltd (1). Even after considering the decision of that case the High Court was of the opinion that the income of the respondents was not received in British India and answered the question against the Revenue. The High Court refused to give leave to appeal to this Court and it was this Court which gave special leave to appeal. The question is whether the amounts, of commission paid by cheques, drawn respectively on banks at Madras and Bombay and respectively posted from Madura and Bombay, can in the circumstances of this case be held to have been received in what was British India or at Secunderabad ? The Appellate Tribunal found that all the cheques whether from Madura or from Bombay were sent by the two respective firms from Madura or Bombay and were received by the respondents at Secunderabad and were treated as payment. The question still remains as to the effect of the sending of the cheques from Madura or Bombay by post. If there is an express request by the (1) 1955 1 S. C. R. 185. creditor that the amount be paid by cheques to be sent by post and they are so sent there is no doubt that the payment will be taken to be at the place where the cheque or cheques are posted. The respondents argued that there was an agreement between the Madura and Bombay firms and the respondents that the money would be paid whether in cash or by cheque at Secunderabad and therefore when the cheques were sent by post the post office was the agent of the debtor and not of the respondents. There is in support of the respondents an affidavit which was filed in the assessment proceedings and which was relied upon in the High Court. According to this affidavit it was verbally agreed that the commission would be paid at Secunderabad in cash or by cheque (as the case may be), the language used in the affidavit was The above commission was verbally decided to be paid to Messrs. Patney Co. Ltd., Secunderabad the Agent Company in Hyderabad State at Secunderabad in cash or by cheque as the case might be . In the case of payment by cheques sent by post the determination of the place of payment would depend upon the agreement between the parties or the course of conduct of the parties. If it is shown that the creditor authorised the debtor either expressly or impliedly to send a cheque by post the property in the cheque passes to the creditor as soon as it is posted. Therefore the post office is an agent of the person to whom the cheque is posted if there be an express or implied authority to send it by post (Commissioner of Income-tax v. Ogale Glass Works Ltd. (1)). In that case there was an express request of the assessee to remit the amount of the bills outstanding against the debtor, that is, Government of India by means of cheques. But it was observed by this Court that according to the course of business usage in general which has to be considered as a part of the surrounding circumstances the parties must have intended that the cheques should be sent by post which is the usual and normal mode of transmission and therefore the posting of cheques in Delhi amounted to payment in (1) 1955 1 S.C.R. 185. Delhi to the post office which was constituted the agent of the assessee. But it was argued for the respondents that in the absence of such a request the post office could not be constituted as the agent of the creditor and relied on a passage in Ogales case (1) at p. 204 where it was observed- Of course if there be no such request, express or implied, then the delivery of the letter or the cheque to the post office is delivery to the agent of the sender himself . It was further contended that in this case there was an express agreement that the payment was to be made at Secunderabad and therefore the matter does not fall within the rule in Ogale Glass Works case (1) and the following principle laid down in judgment by Das, J. (as he then was), is inapplicable - Applying the above principles to the facts found by the Tribunal the position appears to be this. The engagement of the Government was to make payment by cheques. The cheques were drawn in Delhi and received by the assessee in Aundh by post.DECISION ??"
128.0,Tax,"Against the judgment and order of the High Court of Madras allowing a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution. The question there raised was the legality of the assessment of Sales Tax by appellant No. 2, the Deputy Commercial Sales Tax Officer, Saidapet, under the Madras General Sales Tax Act, 1939 (Act IX of 1939), hereinafter termed the Act. The respondent was a partnership firm carrying on tannery business at Chromepet near the city of Madras. Before the year of assessment, i. e., 1952-53, it was taking out licences under the relevant provisions of the Act but it did not renew the licence for the assessment year. When called upon to make a return it did not do so nor did it raise any objection to the notice served on it on February 28, 1954. It was assessed to sales tax of Rs. 10,584 on a turnover of Rs. 6,77,374-4-4. It filed a petition under Art. 226 to quash the assessment order on the ground that the order was illegal and not supported by the authority of law. This contention was accepted by the High Court and the petition was allowed with costs. The consequence of the judgment is that the respondent firm which is not a licensed dealer under the Act is not liable to any sales tax in respect of its dealings in hides and skins. Against this judgment and order the appellants have come to this court by special leave. The contention of the respondent firm in the High Court was that under s. 5, cl. (vi) of the Act, the liability to pay sales tax in respect of hides and skins could only be at a single point that the rule limiting the operation of this mode of taxation to licensed dealers was ultra vires and therefore r. 16(5) of the Madras General Sales Tax (Turnover and Assessment) Rules, 1939, hereinafter called the Turnover and Assessment Rules, was void and inoperative and had been. so held by the Supreme Court in V. M. Syed Mohammed Co. v. The State of Madras(1) that accepting this interpretation the State of Madras had deleted cl. (5) of r. 16 by G. 0. 450, Revenue, dated February 26, 1954, i.e., two days before the making of the assessment order under dispute that r. 16(5) of the Turnover and Assessment Rules was the only provision imposing a multiple tax in respect of sales of hides and skins by unlicensed dealers and that the imposition of the sales tax after the repeal of that rule was illegal and the tax was without the authority of law. It was also contended that in the taxation scheme under the Act, hides and skins, because of their importance in the international market, were excluded from the direct operation of s. 3(1) of the Act which was the general charging section and were given special protection of the single point taxation under s. 5(vi). The (1) 1954 S.C.R. 1117. argument, therefore, was that in the case of sales of hides and skins the general provision was inapplicable and a special rule for taxation was laid down by s. 5(vi) of the Act. The High Court held that in the case of hides and it skins the charge levied by s. 3 is subject to the pro. visions of S. 5 and in the case of licensed dealers in hides and skins, the charging provision is r. 16 of the Turnover and Assessment Rules . The High Court further held that r. 16(5) of the Turnover and Assessment Rules which restricted the benefit of single point taxation to licensed dealers was ultra vires as it contravened s. 5(vi) of the Act and s. 6-A was not applicable to the case of a dealer who did not take out a licence for dealing in hides and skins and further that if r. 16(5) was ultra vires as being in contravention of s. 5(vi), r. 5, of the Madras General Sales Tax Rules (hereinafter called the Sales Tax Rules) which requires the taking out of the licence in order to be able to get the benefit of single point taxation would also be ultra vires. Thus on a true construction of s. 3(1) and s. 5(vi) it was of the opinion that r. 5 of the Sales Tax Rules and r. 16(5) of the Turnover and Assessment Rules were ultra vires and s. 6A was inapplicable to a person who had not taken out a licence. As a consequence it quashed the order of assessment of the respondent firm. In order to decide this appeal it is necessary to refer to and consider the relevant provisions of the Act and the two sets of Rules made thereunder. They are as follows- S. 3(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act,- (a) every dealer shall pay for each year a tax on his total turnover for such year and A dealer whose total turnover in any year is less than ten thousand rupees shall not be liable to pay any tax for that year under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2). For the purposes of this section and the other provisions of this Act, turnover shall be determined in accordance with such rules as may be prescribed  The taxes under sub-sections (1) and (2) shall be assessed, levied and collected in such manner and in such instalments, if any, as may be prescribed S. 5. Subject to such restrictions and conditions as may be prescribed, including conditions as to licences and licence fees. the sale of hides and skins, whether tanned or untanned shall be liable to tax under section 3, subsection (1), only at such single point in the series of sales by successive dealers as may be prescribed. S. 6A. If any restrictions or conditions prescribed under section 5 or notified under section 6 are contravened or are not observed by a dealer, or in case a condition so prescribed or notified requires that a licence shall be taken out or renewed, if a licence is not taken out or renewed, by the dealer or if any of the conditions of a licence taken out or renewed by him are contravened or are not observed, the sales of the dealer, with effect from the commencement of the year in which such contravention or non- observance took place, may be assessed to tax or taxes under section 3, as if the provisions of section 5 or of the notification under section 6, as the case may be, did not apply to such sales and notwithstanding that a licence, if any, taken out or renewed by the dealer continued or continues to be in force during the year . MADRAS GENERAL SALES TAX (TURNOVER AND ASSESSMENT) RULES. Rule 4(1). Save as provided in sub-rule (2) the gross turnover of a dealer for the purposes of these rules shall be the amount for which goods are sold by the dealer. In the case of the undermentioned goods turnover of a dealer for the purposes of these rules shall be the amount for which the goods are bought by the dealer. (c) untanned hides and skins bought by a licensed tanner in the State, and (d) untanned hides and skins exported outside the State by a licensed dealer in hides or skins. Rule 15(1). Rules 6 to 13 shall not apply to licensed tanners and other licensed dealers in hides or skins in respect of their dealings in hides or skins but the provisions of this and the following rule shall apply to them in respect of such dealings. Rule 16(1). In the case of hides and skins, the tax payable under section 3(1) shall be levied in accordance with the provisions of this rule. No tax shall be levied on the sale of untanned hides or skins by a licensed dealer in hides or skins except at the stage at which such hides or skins are sold to a tanner in the State or are sold for export outside the State in the case of all untanned hides or skins sold to a tanner in the State, the tax shall be levied from the tanner on the amount for which the hides or skins are bought by him.  In the case of all untanned hides or skins which are not sold to a tanner in the State but are exported outside the State, the tax shall be levied from the dealer who was the last dealer not exempt from taxation under section 3(3), who buys them in the State on the amount for which they were bought by him. Sale of hides or skins by dealers other than licensed dealers in hides or skins shall,subject to the provisions of section 3, be liable to taxation on each occasion of sale. Rule 5(1) of the ax Rules provides - Every person who (d) deals in hides and or skins whether as a tanner, or otherwise, or shall, if he desires to avail himself of the exemption provided in sections 5 and 8 or of the concession of single point taxation provided in section 6, submit an application in Form 1 for a licence in respect of each of his places of business to the authority specified in sub- rule (2) so as to reach him not later than the 15th day of October, 1939 . The scheme of taxation under the Act is this. Section 3 is the general charging section under which tax is levied in the manner prescribed in the turnover of a dealer, except that a dealer whose turnover is less than Rs. 10,000/- is exempted from sales tax. Section 3 envisages multipoint taxation on the total turnover of a dealer. In the case of the sale transactions of certain specified goods set out in s. 5 of the Act an exception is made. That section provides for single point taxation subject to certain prescribed restrictions and conditions. By sub-s. (vi) of that section sales of hides and skins are liable to tax under s.3, sub-s. (1), at one single point in the series of sales by successive dealers. The language of the section (s.5) shows however that this exemption applies subject to certain restrictions and conditions which include conditions as to licences. The rule, which deals with licences is r. 5 of the Sales Tax Rules, the relevant portion of which has already been set out It lays down that if a dealer desires to avail himself of the exemption provided in ss. 5 and 8 or of the concession as to taxation in s. 5 only at a single point, then he must obtain a licence as prescribed in that rule. If the restrictions and conditions contemplated by s. 5 read with the rules are not complied with, certain consequences follow as a result of s. 6-A of the Act which specifically states that where a condition prescribed or notified requires the taking out or the renewal of a licence, then in the case of contravention of such conditions or restrictions the tax is to be levied under s. 3 as if the provisions of s. 5 did not apply to such sales. This, therefore, is a clear provision which makes the single point imposition of sales tax on hides and skins to be conditional on observing the condition of taking a licence. The argument of inconsistency between r. 16(5) of the Turnover and Assessment Rules and s. 5(vi) of the Act which was accepted in the High Court receives no support from the language of that section which is a concessional provision for making the sales of hides and skins liable to taxation at a single point but that, as the opening words of the section show, is subject to restrictions and conditions prescribed in the rules and one of these conditions is the taking of a licence. All that r. 16(5) does is to emphasise the consequences of non- observance of the conditions which ss. 5(vi) 6-A have in clear terms prescribed. We find no inconsistency between the rule and the sections of the Act. But it was submitted that this Court on appeal from a judgment of the Madras High Court had sId r. 16(5) to be ultra vires the Act. That contention is based on the judgment of the Madras High Court in V. M. Syed Mohammed Company v. The State of Madras (1) which on appeal was affirmed by this Court (2). This contention is not well-founded. In that case, when it was in the Madras High Court, it was contended that the rules did not properly carry out the policy underlying the Act, which was to keep the price of hides and skins at a competitive level for the world market. It was there argued that hides and skins were articles much in demand in the foreign markets and their export was one of the main items of the foreign trade of the State of Madras which enjoyed considerable natural advantage in tanning because of the plentiful supply of Avaram bark which was specially suited for the purpose. It was also argued that untanned hides and skins were acquired locally or by import from other States and were either tanned in the State or exported and therefore the scheme of taxation was to levy the tax at a single point, i.e., at the stage when articles were tanned in the State or exported to foreign countries for tanning. For this reason multiple taxation was violative of s. 5(vi) of the Act. This, it appears, was not disputed by the Government and it was therefore held that r. 16(5) of the Turnover and Assessment Rules was ultra vires. But the question was really (1) (1952) 3 S.T.C. 367. V. M. Syed Mohammed and Company v. The State of Andhra, 1954 S.C.R. 1117. not relevant to the issue as was pointed out by Venkatarama Ayyar, J., at p. 394, where he said- Now the contention of the petitioners is that where there are sales by unlicensed dealers to unlicensed tanners or unlicensed dealers, there is the possibility of multiple taxation and that would be in violation of section 5(vi). It is not disputed on behalf of the Government that Rule 16(5) is repugnant to section 5(vi). It must therefore be held to be ultra vires. But this can bring no relief to the petitioners, as they are all licensed tanners and are in no manner hurt by the operation of r. 16(5). This was conceded by the learned Advocate for the petitioners . This case was then brought in appeal to this Court and S. R. Das, J. (as he then was), observed at p. 1121- Lastly, the learned advocate urges that rule 16 (5) clearly contravenes the provisions of section 5(vi) of the Act. This sub-rule has been held to be ultra vires by the High Court, and indeed, the learned Advocate General of Madras did not in the High Court, as before us, dispute that rule 16(5) was repugnant to ,section 5(vi). That sub-rule, however affects only unlicensed dealers and the appellants who are admittedly licensed dealers are not affected by that sub-rule .DECISION ??"
129.0,Tax,"Against the judgment and order of the High Court of Madras allowing a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution. The question there raised was the legality of the assessment of Sales Tax by appellant No. 2, the Deputy Commercial Sales Tax Officer, Saidapet, under the Madras General Sales Tax Act, 1939 (Act IX of 1939), hereinafter termed the Act. The respondent was a partnership firm carrying on tannery business at Chromepet near the city of Madras. Before the year of assessment, i. e., 1952-53, it was taking out licences under the relevant provisions of the Act but it did not renew the licence for the assessment year. When called upon to make a return it did not do so nor did it raise any objection to the notice served on it on February 28, 1954. It was assessed to sales tax of Rs. 10,584 on a turnover of Rs. 6,77,374-4-4. It filed a petition under Art. 226 to quash the assessment order on the ground that the order was illegal and not supported by the authority of law. This contention was accepted by the High Court and the petition was allowed with costs. The consequence of the judgment is that the respondent firm which is not a licensed dealer under the Act is not liable to any sales tax in respect of its dealings in hides and skins. Against this judgment and order the appellants have come to this court by special leave. The contention of the respondent firm in the High Court was that under s. 5, cl. (vi) of the Act, the liability to pay sales tax in respect of hides and skins could only be at a single point that the rule limiting the operation of this mode of taxation to licensed dealers was ultra vires and therefore r. 16(5) of the Madras General Sales Tax (Turnover and Assessment) Rules, 1939, hereinafter called the Turnover and Assessment Rules, was void and inoperative and had been. so held by the Supreme Court in V. M. Syed Mohammed Co. v. The State of Madras(1) that accepting this interpretation the State of Madras had deleted cl. (5) of r. 16 by G. 0. 450, Revenue, dated February 26, 1954, i.e., two days before the making of the assessment order under dispute that r. 16(5) of the Turnover and Assessment Rules was the only provision imposing a multiple tax in respect of sales of hides and skins by unlicensed dealers and that the imposition of the sales tax after the repeal of that rule was illegal and the tax was without the authority of law. It was also contended that in the taxation scheme under the Act, hides and skins, because of their importance in the international market, were excluded from the direct operation of s. 3(1) of the Act which was the general charging section and were given special protection of the single point taxation under s. 5(vi). The (1) 1954 S.C.R. 1117. argument, therefore, was that in the case of sales of hides and skins the general provision was inapplicable and a special rule for taxation was laid down by s. 5(vi) of the Act. The High Court held that in the case of hides and it skins the charge levied by s. 3 is subject to the pro. visions of S. 5 and in the case of licensed dealers in hides and skins, the charging provision is r. 16 of the Turnover and Assessment Rules . The High Court further held that r. 16(5) of the Turnover and Assessment Rules which restricted the benefit of single point taxation to licensed dealers was ultra vires as it contravened s. 5(vi) of the Act and s. 6-A was not applicable to the case of a dealer who did not take out a licence for dealing in hides and skins and further that if r. 16(5) was ultra vires as being in contravention of s. 5(vi), r. 5, of the Madras General Sales Tax Rules (hereinafter called the Sales Tax Rules) which requires the taking out of the licence in order to be able to get the benefit of single point taxation would also be ultra vires. Thus on a true construction of s. 3(1) and s. 5(vi) it was of the opinion that r. 5 of the Sales Tax Rules and r. 16(5) of the Turnover and Assessment Rules were ultra vires and s. 6A was inapplicable to a person who had not taken out a licence. As a consequence it quashed the order of assessment of the respondent firm. In order to decide this appeal it is necessary to refer to and consider the relevant provisions of the Act and the two sets of Rules made thereunder. They are as follows- S. 3(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act,- (a) every dealer shall pay for each year a tax on his total turnover for such year and A dealer whose total turnover in any year is less than ten thousand rupees shall not be liable to pay any tax for that year under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2). For the purposes of this section and the other provisions of this Act, turnover shall be determined in accordance with such rules as may be prescribed  The taxes under sub-sections (1) and (2) shall be assessed, levied and collected in such manner and in such instalments, if any, as may be prescribed S. 5. Subject to such restrictions and conditions as may be prescribed, including conditions as to licences and licence fees. the sale of hides and skins, whether tanned or untanned shall be liable to tax under section 3, subsection (1), only at such single point in the series of sales by successive dealers as may be prescribed. S. 6A. If any restrictions or conditions prescribed under section 5 or notified under section 6 are contravened or are not observed by a dealer, or in case a condition so prescribed or notified requires that a licence shall be taken out or renewed, if a licence is not taken out or renewed, by the dealer or if any of the conditions of a licence taken out or renewed by him are contravened or are not observed, the sales of the dealer, with effect from the commencement of the year in which such contravention or non- observance took place, may be assessed to tax or taxes under section 3, as if the provisions of section 5 or of the notification under section 6, as the case may be, did not apply to such sales and notwithstanding that a licence, if any, taken out or renewed by the dealer continued or continues to be in force during the year . MADRAS GENERAL SALES TAX (TURNOVER AND ASSESSMENT) RULES. Rule 4(1). Save as provided in sub-rule (2) the gross turnover of a dealer for the purposes of these rules shall be the amount for which goods are sold by the dealer. In the case of the undermentioned goods turnover of a dealer for the purposes of these rules shall be the amount for which the goods are bought by the dealer. (c) untanned hides and skins bought by a licensed tanner in the State, and (d) untanned hides and skins exported outside the State by a licensed dealer in hides or skins. Rule 15(1). Rules 6 to 13 shall not apply to licensed tanners and other licensed dealers in hides or skins in respect of their dealings in hides or skins but the provisions of this and the following rule shall apply to them in respect of such dealings. Rule 16(1). In the case of hides and skins, the tax payable under section 3(1) shall be levied in accordance with the provisions of this rule. No tax shall be levied on the sale of untanned hides or skins by a licensed dealer in hides or skins except at the stage at which such hides or skins are sold to a tanner in the State or are sold for export outside the State in the case of all untanned hides or skins sold to a tanner in the State, the tax shall be levied from the tanner on the amount for which the hides or skins are bought by him.  In the case of all untanned hides or skins which are not sold to a tanner in the State but are exported outside the State, the tax shall be levied from the dealer who was the last dealer not exempt from taxation under section 3(3), who buys them in the State on the amount for which they were bought by him. Sale of hides or skins by dealers other than licensed dealers in hides or skins shall,subject to the provisions of section 3, be liable to taxation on each occasion of sale. Rule 5(1) of the ax Rules provides - Every person who (d) deals in hides and or skins whether as a tanner, or otherwise, or shall, if he desires to avail himself of the exemption provided in sections 5 and 8 or of the concession of single point taxation provided in section 6, submit an application in Form 1 for a licence in respect of each of his places of business to the authority specified in sub- rule (2) so as to reach him not later than the 15th day of October, 1939 . The scheme of taxation under the Act is this. Section 3 is the general charging section under which tax is levied in the manner prescribed in the turnover of a dealer, except that a dealer whose turnover is less than Rs. 10,000/- is exempted from sales tax. Section 3 envisages multipoint taxation on the total turnover of a dealer. In the case of the sale transactions of certain specified goods set out in s. 5 of the Act an exception is made. That section provides for single point taxation subject to certain prescribed restrictions and conditions. By sub-s. (vi) of that section sales of hides and skins are liable to tax under s.3, sub-s. (1), at one single point in the series of sales by successive dealers. The language of the section (s.5) shows however that this exemption applies subject to certain restrictions and conditions which include conditions as to licences. The rule, which deals with licences is r. 5 of the Sales Tax Rules, the relevant portion of which has already been set out It lays down that if a dealer desires to avail himself of the exemption provided in ss. 5 and 8 or of the concession as to taxation in s. 5 only at a single point, then he must obtain a licence as prescribed in that rule. If the restrictions and conditions contemplated by s. 5 read with the rules are not complied with, certain consequences follow as a result of s. 6-A of the Act which specifically states that where a condition prescribed or notified requires the taking out or the renewal of a licence, then in the case of contravention of such conditions or restrictions the tax is to be levied under s. 3 as if the provisions of s. 5 did not apply to such sales. This, therefore, is a clear provision which makes the single point imposition of sales tax on hides and skins to be conditional on observing the condition of taking a licence. The argument of inconsistency between r. 16(5) of the Turnover and Assessment Rules and s. 5(vi) of the Act which was accepted in the High Court receives no support from the language of that section which is a concessional provision for making the sales of hides and skins liable to taxation at a single point but that, as the opening words of the section show, is subject to restrictions and conditions prescribed in the rules and one of these conditions is the taking of a licence. All that r. 16(5) does is to emphasise the consequences of non- observance of the conditions which ss. 5(vi) 6-A have in clear terms prescribed. We find no inconsistency between the rule and the sections of the Act. But it was submitted that this Court on appeal from a judgment of the Madras High Court had sId r. 16(5) to be ultra vires the Act. That contention is based on the judgment of the Madras High Court in V. M. Syed Mohammed Company v. The State of Madras (1) which on appeal was affirmed by this Court (2). This contention is not well-founded. In that case, when it was in the Madras High Court, it was contended that the rules did not properly carry out the policy underlying the Act, which was to keep the price of hides and skins at a competitive level for the world market.

For this reason multiple taxation was violative of s. 5(vi) of the Act. This, it appears, was not disputed by the Government and it was therefore held that r. 16(5) of the Turnover and Assessment Rules was ultra vires. But the question was really (1) (1952) 3 S.T.C. 367. V. M. Syed Mohammed and Company v.

130.0,Tax,"The State of Kerala and the Tahsildars of Kottayam and Kanjirappally Taluks are the appellants, and C.M. Francis Co., a partnership firm, is the first respondent, and the partners of the firm are the remaining respondents. The respondents were doing business in hill produce like pepper, ginger, betelnuts etc., and were assessed to sales tax under the Travancore-Cochin General Sales Tax Act XI of 1125 (referred to as the Act), for the years 1950 to 1954. The respondents have to pay a sum of Rs. 1,01,716-4-3 as tax. In 1954, proceedings were started against them under s. 13 of the Act, which provides that if the tax is not paid as laid down in that section, the whole of the amount or such part thereof as remains due, may be recovered as if it were an arrears of land revenue. It appears that the pro- ceedings were not fruitful, and a prosecution under s. 19 of the Act was instituted against the partners in the Court of the First Class Magistrate, Ponkunnam. Respondents 2 to 5 pleaded guilty, and the Magistrate passed an order on October 18, 1955 as follows The sentence or other final order A 1 to 4 sentenced to pay a fine of Rs. 50/- each and in default to undergo S. 1. for one month each. A 1 to 4 admit that they failed to pay on demand by the competent authority, a sum of Rs. 1,01,716-4-3 due from them as sales tax for the years 1950 to 1954. This amount will be realised from A 1 to 4, jointly or severally, individually or collectively under the provisions of the Cr.P.C. for realisation of criminal fines, as if it were a fine imposed by this court on each accused individually and all of them together. Take steps for the realisation. Warrants under s. 386 (1) (b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure were issued to the Collector of Kottayam District for recovery of the arrears of sales tax. The authorities, however, started proceedings again under s. 13 of the Act read with the provisions of the Travancore- Cochin Revenue Recovery Act, 1951 (VII of 1951), to recover the amount as arrears of land revenue, and attached some properties belonging to the respondents within the jurisdiction of the second and third appellants, the Tahsildars of Kottayam and Kanjirappally Taluks. The firm thereupon filed the petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution for a writ of prohibition or other order or direction to the effect that the proceedings for realisation of the arrears under the Revenue Recovery Act be quashed. In the petition, the respondents urged that inasmuch as they were prosecuted under s. 19 of the Act and the Magistrate had issued warrants, the procedure for recovery under s. 13 was not available. They contended that under s. 386 of the Code of Criminal Procedure the warrant is to be deemed to be a decree and has to be executed according to civil process applicable to the execution of decrees under the Code of Civil Procedure. They, therefore, submitted that the procedure under s. 19 of the Act was no longer open, and could not be proceeded with. Section 19 of the Act, so far as it is material, reads as follows Any person who (b) fails to pay within the time allowed, any tax assessed on him under this Act, or (d)fraudulently evades the payment of any tax assessed on him shall on conviction by a Magistrate of the first class, be liable to a fine which may extend to one thousand rupees and in the case of a conviction under clause (b), (d) the Magistrate shall specify in the order the tax which the person convicted has failed or evaded to pay and the tax so specified shall be recoverable as if it were a fine under the Code of Criminal Procedure for the timebeing in force. In dealing with the question, the learned Judges of the High Court felt that s. 13 of the Act was in the nature of a general law, over which the special procedure prescribed by s. 19 of the Act read with s. 386 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was to prevail. They, however, thought that, since all the processes available under s. 19 of the Act were also available under s. 386 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, it was not necessary to decide what would happen if the proceedings under s. 386 came to nothing. They observed that if the question arose, they would consider it. The writ of prohibition was granted by the High Court. The respondents did not appear in this Court. We have heard learned counsel for the appellants, who has drawn our attention to all the relevant provisions of the law. The question which arises is whether s. 19 must be taken to prevail over s. 13 of the Act. Both the sections lay down the mode for recovery of arrears of tax, and, as has already been noticed by the High Court, lead to the application of the process for recovery by attachment and sale of movable and immovable properties, belonging to the tax-evader. It cannot be said that one proceeding is more general than the other, because there is much that is common between them, in so far as the mode of recovery is concerned. Section 19, in addition to recovery of the amount, gives the power to the Magistrate to convict and sentence the offender to fine or in default of payment of fine, to imprisonment.DECISION ??"
131.0,Tax,"This is an appeal with special leave under article 136 of the Constitution against the order of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay, refusing to call for a statement of case from the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal under section 66(2) of the Income-tax Act. The appellants are a registered firm carrying on the business of money- lending and speculation in silver and shares. The partners of the appellants firm were also partners of Messrs. Morarka Co., who were the managing agents of the Sholapur Spinning and Weaving Company Ltd. - hereinafter called the Sholapur Mills. The firm commenced business in August, 1942. In Samvat year 2000 (November, 1943, to October, 1944) the appellants purchased seventeen ordinary shares of the Sholapur Mills and thereafter they purchased 82 more ordinary shares between November, 1944, and October, 1948. By November, 1948, the appellants held 99 ordinary shares. The appellants also purchased at diverse times 6,780 preference shares of the Sholapur Mills. All these shares were entered in the books of account of the appellants as stock-in-trade and valued accordingly at the end of each accounting period. During all these years, not a single shares, ordinary or preference, was sold by the appellants. The following table sets out the profit and loss in respect of these shares calculated by the appellants according to the method of valuation of stock adopted by the appellants. Year of Account Assessment year Ordinary shares Preference shares (Maru) Rs. Rs. 2000-01 1945-46 Loss 30,802 Nil. 2001-02 1946-47 Loss 35,468-8-0 Nil. 2002-03 1947-48 Profit 72,545 Nil. 2003-05 1949-50 Loss 3,21,831 Loss 12,020 The appellants submitted their returns for income-tax in respect of the assessment years 1945-46, 1946-47 and 1947-48 with the Income-tax Officer respectively on July 27, 1948, November 11, 1948, and May 23, 1949. In the proceedings for assessment of tax in the assessment years 1945-46 and 1946-47, the Income-tax Officer disallowed the loss claimed holding that the shares formed the appellants capital investment. In the assessment year 1947-48, the Income-tax Officer excluded from the return the amount of profit alleged to have resulted to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner by three orders dated May 4, 1951, the shares of the Sholapur Mills were held to be stock-in-trade and the profits or losses computed according to the method of valuation adopted by the appellants were directed to be taken into account in assessing the taxable income. These orders were not challenged in appeals to the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal. In the assessment year 1948-49, the appellants did not furnish return and they were assessed to tax under section 23(4) of the Income-tax Act. For the assessment year 1949-50, the appellants furnished their return claiming that they incurred a loss of Rs. 3,33,851 in the shares of the Sholapur Mills. This was computed on the alleged difference between the market value of the shares at the close of the previous year of account and the market value at the end of the accounting period, the shares being treated as stock-in-trade. The Income-tax Officer found that the appellants had inflated the loss by Rs. 1,85,000 and that the shares being capital investment and not stock-in-trade, the loss could not be allowed as a revenue deduction. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner disagreed with the view of the Income-tax Officer and held that the shares were the stock-in-trade of the appellants, but agreeing with the Income-tax Officer he held that the loss had been inflated by Rs. 1,85,000. Against this order, the Income-tax Officer appealed to the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal which reversed the order of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and restored the order of the Income-tax Officer. The Tribunal held that the mere fact that in the previous years the shares were treated as stock-in-trade and the profits and losses in respect thereof were included in the taxable income of the appellants did not preclude the Tribunal from arriving at the conclusion that the shares were capital investment. They substantially confirmed the view of the Income-tax Officer on the facts found. An application submitted by the appellants for a reference under section 66 (1) of the Income-tax Act of the following questions was rejected by the Tribunal. Whether the Tribunal misdirected itself in law and or acted without any evidence in finding that the investment of the assessee in the shares of the Sholapur Mills was a capital investment and not its stock-in-trade ? Whether in any event in view of the assessments made for the years 1945-46, 1946-47 and 1947-48 and the Appellate Assistant Commissioners order for these three years, it was open to the department to hold for the assessment years 1949-50 that the said shares do not represent the assessees stock-in-trade ? Whether the Tribunal misdirected itself in law in omitting to consider certain material facts which were taken into account by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and expressly maintained in the Appellate Assistant Commissioners order, including the fact that the assessee had been holding shares in several other companies as stock- in-trade and this position has been accepted by the department although in those shares there have been preferred with special leave. In our view, the High Court was right in refusing to call for a statement of the case under section 66(2) of the Income-tax Act. The conclusion of the Tribunal was based on inferences of fact raised from materials before the taxing authorities. The conduct of the appellants clearly indicated that even though they were dealing in shares of other companies, the shares of the Sholapur Mills were treated by them as capital investment for the purpose of maintaining their managing agency. The number of shares held by the appellants went on increasing from time to time and not a single share was ever sold. The Tribunal pointed out that the returns for the assessment years 1945-46, 1946-47 and 1947-48 were filed by the appellants after they knew that there were wide fluctuations in the quotation of the shares of that company. They also referred to the circumstance that the appellants were interested in the managing agency of the Sholapur Mills and that every member of the family of the appellants was holding shares   The conclusion of the Tribunal was amply supported by evidence. It can not be said that because in the previous years the shares were held to be stock-in-trade, they must be similarly treated for the assessment year 1949-50. In the matter of assessment of income-tax, each years assessment is complete and the decision arrived at in a previous year on material before the taxing authorities cannot be regarded as binding in the assessment for the subsequent years. The Tribunal is not shown to have omitted to consider the material facts. The decision of the Tribunal was on a question of fact and no question of law arose which could be directed to be referred under section 66(2) of the Income-tax Act.DECISION ??"

Morarka Co., who were the managing agents of the Sholapur Spinning and Weaving Company Ltd. - hereinafter called the Sholapur Mills. The firm commenced business in August, 1942. In Samvat year 2000 (November, 1943, to October, 1944) the appellants purchased seventeen ordinary shares of the Sholapur Mills and thereafter they purchased 82 more ordinary shares between November, 1944, and October, 1948. By November, 1948, the appellants held 99 ordinary shares. The appellants also purchased at diverse times 6,780 preference shares of the Sholapur Mills. All these shares were entered in the books of account of the appellants as stock-in-trade and valued accordingly at the end of each accounting period. During all these years, not a single shares, ordinary or preference, was sold by the appellants. The following table sets out the profit and loss in respect of these shares calculated by the appellants according to the method of valuation of stock adopted by the appellants. Year of Account Assessment year Ordinary shares Preference shares (Maru) Rs. Rs. 2000-01 1945-46 Loss 30,802 Nil. 2001-02 1946-47 Loss 35,468-8-0 Nil. 2002-03 1947-48 Profit 72,545 Nil. 2003-05 1949-50 Loss 3,21,831 Loss 12,020 The appellants submitted their returns for income-tax in respect of the assessment years 1945-46, 1946-47 and 1947-48 with the Income-tax Officer respectively on July 27, 1948, November 11, 1948, and May 23, 1949. In the proceedings for assessment of tax in the assessment years 1945-46 and 1946-47, the Income-tax Officer disallowed the loss claimed holding that the shares formed the appellants capital investment. In the assessment year 1947-48, the Income-tax Officer excluded from the return the amount of profit alleged to have resulted to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner by three orders dated May 4, 1951, the shares of the Sholapur Mills were held to be stock-in-trade and the profits or losses computed according to the method of valuation adopted by the appellants were directed to be taken into account in assessing the taxable income. These orders were not challenged in appeals to the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal. In the assessment year 1948-49, the appellants did not furnish return and they were assessed to tax under section 23(4) of the Income-tax Act. For the assessment year 1949-50, the appellants furnished their return claiming that they incurred a loss of Rs. 3,33,851 in the shares of the Sholapur Mills. This was computed on the alleged difference between the market value of the shares at the close of the previous year of account and the market value at the end of the accounting period, the shares being treated as stock-in-trade. The Income-tax Officer found that the appellants had inflated the loss by Rs. 1,85,000 and that the shares being capital investment and not stock-in-trade, the loss could not be allowed as a revenue deduction. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner disagreed with the view of the Income-tax Officer and held that the shares were the stock-in-trade of the appellants, but agreeing with the Income-tax Officer he held that the loss had been inflated by Rs. 1,85,000. Against this order, the Income-tax Officer appealed to the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal which reversed the order of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and restored the order of the Income-tax Officer. The Tribunal held that the mere fact that in the previous years the shares were treated as stock-in-trade and the profits and losses in respect thereof were included in the taxable income of the appellants did not preclude the Tribunal from arriving at the conclusion that the shares were capital investment. They substantially confirmed the view of the Income-tax Officer on the facts found. An application submitted by the appellants for a reference under section 66 (1) of the Income-tax Act of the following questions was rejected by the Tribunal. Whether the Tribunal misdirected itself in law and or acted without any evidence in finding that the investment of the assessee in the shares of the Sholapur Mills was a capital investment and not its stock-in-trade ? Whether in any event in view of the assessments made for the years 1945-46, 1946-47 and 1947-48 and the Appellate Assistant Commissioners order for these three years, it was open to the department to hold for the assessment years 1949-50 that the said shares do not represent the assessees stock-in-trade ? Whether the Tribunal misdirected itself in law in omitting to consider certain material facts which were taken into account by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and expressly maintained in the Appellate Assistant Commissioners order, including the fact that the assessee had been holding shares in several other companies as stock- in-trade and this position has been accepted by the department although in those shares there have been preferred with special leave. In our view, the High Court was right in refusing to call for a statement of the case under section 66(2) of the Income-tax Act. The conclusion of the Tribunal was based on inferences of fact raised from materials before the taxing authorities. The conduct of the appellants clearly indicated that even though they were dealing in shares of other companies, the shares of the Sholapur Mills were treated by them as capital investment for the purpose of maintaining their managing agency. The number of shares held by the appellants went on increasing from time to time and not a single share was ever sold. The Tribunal pointed out that the returns for the assessment years 1945-46, 1946-47 and 1947-48 were filed by the appellants after they knew that there were wide fluctuations in the quotation of the shares of that company. They also referred to the circumstance that the appellants were interested in the managing agency of the Sholapur Mills and that every member of the family of the appellants was holding shares   The conclusion of the Tribunal was amply supported by evidence. It can not be said that because in the previous years the shares were held to be stock-in-trade, they must be similarly treated for the assessment year 1949-50. In the matter of assessment of income-tax, each years assessment is complete and the decision arrived at in a previous year on material before the taxing authorities cannot be regarded as binding in the assessment for the subsequent years. The Tribunal is not shown to have omitted to consider the material facts. The decision of the Tribunal was on a question of fact and no question of law arose which could be directed to be referred under section 66(2) of the Income-tax Act.DECISION ??"
133.0,Tax,"Shah, J. The High Court of Judicature at Bombay answered in the affirmative the following two questions which were referred by the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal, Bombay, under sections 66(2) of the Income-tax Act. Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the Tribunal was justified in law in adding to the total income of the assessee the sum of Rs. 1,45,706 and or Rs. 48,185 or any part thereof ? Whether there was any material on record to support the finding that Rs. 1,45,706 and or 48,185 or any part thereof represent the income of the assessee ? With special leave the assessees, Messrs. C. Vasantlal Co., have appealed to this court. The assessees carried on business as commission agents and brokers and also in forward transactions in cotton, bullion and other commodities. In the course of proceedings for assessment of income-tax of the assessees, for the assessment year 1947-48, two entries in the assessees books of accounts for Samvat 2002 (which was the previous year for the purpose of assessment) showing payments of Rs. 48,185 and Rs. 1,45,706 to Messrs. Meghaji Kapurchand and Messrs. Bhimaji Motiji respectively were noticed by the Income-tax Officer. A partner of the assessees explained that these two parties were their constituents, and had entered into speculative transactions through them as brokers with Bhawanji Lakhmichand and Joitram Kedarnath and that the latter had suffered losses which aggregated to Rs. 12,303 and Rs. 1,81,587 respectively and that the payments to the assessees by the said two persons were passed on to these two constituents. The Income-tax Officer was not satisfied with the explanation and examined Achaldas, a partner of Messrs. Meghaji Kapurchand, and Poonamchand, a partner of Messrs. Bhimaji Motiji. On a consideration of the material placed before him the Income-tax Officer held that the entries made in the relevant account books maintained by the assessees were fictitious, and in computing their income disallowed the assessees claim in respect of the amounts of Rs. 1,45,706 and Rs. 48,185. The assessee appealed against the order of assessment to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner, Bombay. It was urged before that officer that Achaldas and Poonamchand, partners of Messrs. Meghaji Kapurchand and Messrs. Bhimaji Motiji, were examined by the Income-tax Officer in the absence of the assessees and they had no opportunity of cross-examining them. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner summoned these two persons to appear before him and permitted the assessees to cross examine them. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner held that the transaction in cotton which were entered in the books of accounts of the assessees were not genuine but the assessees had merely acted as brokers or mediators, Joitram Kedarnath and Bhawanji Lakhmichand having directly bought losses from Messrs. Meghaji Kapurchand and Messrs. Bhimaji Motiji. He, therefore, directed that an amount of Rs. 1,94,890 be excluded in computing the assessees total income. The department appealed against the order of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner to the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal, Bombay. The Tribunal reversed the order passed by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and restored the order passed by the Income-tax Officer. The Tribunal under the direction of the High Court of Bombay submitted a statement of the case and referred the two questions set out hereinbefore. The High Court after an exhaustive review of the evidence held that there was material on the record to support the findings of the Tribunal that the sums of Rs. 1,45,706 and Rs. 48,185 which were the subject-matter of the reference represented the income of the assessees. The Income-tax Appellate Tribunal on a review of the evidence recorded the following findings. That the assessees in the years previous to Samvat 2002 had no transactions with Messrs. Meghaji Kapurchand or with Messrs. Bhimaji Motiji and it was not possible to believe that transactions involving large sums of money would be put through by the assessees in respect of new constituents without taking any deposit or security. That the entries made in the books of accounts of the assessees were suspicious and appeared to have been written not in the usual course of business. That the transactions with Messrs. Meghaji Kapurchand and Messrs. Bhimaji Motiji always showed gains in their favour, there being not a single transactions were they had suffered loss. This in the opinion of the Appellate Tribunal was unrealistic. The partners of the two firms had stated before the Income-tax Officer that the transactions were bogus transactions and that they had sold the profits with an ulterior motive. Even in their statements before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner Achaldas and Poonamchand did not pretend that these transactions were genuine transactions. They merely asserted that the transactions were effected by persons who were not available at the time of the enquiry. That Messrs. Meghaji Kapurchand and Messrs. Bhimaji Motiji had encashed the cheques issued by the assessees and admitted that they had paid back the amounts thereof. Before the Income-tax Officer they stated that the amounts of the cheques were returned by them to the assessees but before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner they stated that they had returned those amounts to unknown and unidentifiable parties. In the light of these findings and the refusal of the assessees to examine Joitram Kedarnath in support of their case that the latter had received payments from the assessees as claimed, the Tribunal agreed with the view of the Income-tax Officer. By the two questions referred, the High Court was called upon to advise the Tribunal whether there was any material on the record to support the finding that the amount of Rs. 1,45,706 and Rs. 48,185 represented the income of the assessees. Counsel for the assessees in this appeal has contended that the statements of Achaldas and Poonamchand who were examined by the Income-tax Officer in the absence of the assessees could not be regarded as evidence against the assessees and that the only legal evidence on the record was the statement of these witnesses before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and therein the witnesses absolved the assessees from any complicity in the transactions. We are unable to hold that the statements made by Achaldas and Poonamchand before the Income-tax Officer were not material on which the Tribunal could act. The case of the assessees was that the transactions in respect of which they had maintained accounts were genuine transactions and that they had received payment from the parties who suffered losses, and had made it over to the parties who had earned profits. The income-tax authorities held that the transactions were not genuine transactions. Again the evidence of Achaldas and Poonamchand clearly showed that these amounts were repaid. In the statements made by these two persons before the Income- tax Officer it was asserted that the repayment of the amounts of the cheques was made to the assessees. Before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner they stated that they handed over the moneys to some other persons whose presence could not be procured. There is nothing on the record to show that the Income-tax Officer had not disclosed to the assessees the material he had collected by examining Achaldas and Poonamchand. In any event, the Appellate Assistant Commissioner in the interest of justice and fair play gave the assessees an opportunity to cross-examine these two persons. The Income-tax Officer is not bound by any technical rules of the law of evidence. It is open to him to collect materials to facilitates assessment even by private enquiry. But if he desires to use the material so collected, the assessee must be informed of the material and must be given an adequate opportunity of explaining it. The statements made by Achaldas and Poonamchand before the Income-tax Officer were material on which the income-tax authorities could act provided that the material was disclosed and the assessees had opportunity to render their explanation in that behalf. It was therefore open to the Tribunal in appreciating the evidence to rely upon the statements made by Achaldas and Poonamchand before the Income-tax Officer and to disbelieve the statements made by them before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner. The jurisdiction of the High Court under section 66 of the Income-tax Act is merely advisory. The High Court does not sit in appeal over the judgment of the income-tax authorities it is not concerned to decide whether the conclusion of the Tribunal on appreciation of evidence is correct. There was apparently a mass of evidence on which the conclusion of the Appellate Tribunal could be founded and the question which fell to be determined by it was purely one of fact. It is true that a finding of fact which is not supported by any evidence or is unreasonable and perverse may be open to challenge on the ground that it is not supported by any material on the record, but, as we have already observed, there was material on which the Income-tax Tribunal could reasonably arrive at the conclusion which it did. The High Court was, therefore, right in recording the answers to the two questions submitted to it.DECISION ??"
134.0,Tax,"Appeal by special leave from the Resolution dated April 21, 1954, of the Board of Revenue, Bihar Patna in Revision Case No. 706 of 1953. K. Kapur and K.K. Jain, for the appellants. P. Singh, R. K. Garg, M.K. Ramamurthi and C. Agarwal, for the respondents. 1962. February, 2.-The Judgment of the Court was delivered by KAPUR, J.-This appeal by Special Leave against the order of the Board of Revenue, Bihar, relates to the assessment for the year 1950-51 of Sale Tax of the appellant under the Bihar Sales Tax Act, 1947 (Act 19 of 1947), hereinafter called the Act. The appellant was a railway caterer, who had Refreshment Rooms and Tea Stalls at various Railway Stations. He sold various kinds of eatables, cigarettes, betels, milk, fruits and tea at railway stations. He was registered as a dealer under the Act and had been carrying on business for a fairly long time. His case was that as it was difficult for him to maintain accounts in regard to eatables, some of which were taxable and others were not, he made representation in 1944 to the Bihar Government for some arrangement so that the difficulty in keeping different sets of account would be the obviated. As a result of his representation the Bihar Government by a letter June 5, 1915, agreed that the appellants taxable turnover in Bihar would be taken to be 66 2/3 of the, gross turnover during the quarter ending December 31, 1944, and that this percentage might be revised after December 31, 1945. As a result of this letter, the appellant did not keep separate accounts for taxable and non-taxable items and for some of the quarters subsequent to those mentioned in the letter above referred to were also taxed according to the arrangements contained in that letter. For the period April 1, 1950, to March 31, 1951, the gross turnover was Rs. 11,16,270-11-0 and the appellant claimed that he be assessed at 66 2/3 of that amount but the Sales Tax officer taxed him on the total gross turnover except for the usual rebate of 4 allowed in such cases. He submitted that in this turnover there were included tax-free articles such as fresh milks, meat, fish, green vegetables etc., which were exempt from Sales tax under s. 6 of the Act. His submission was that the excess amount assessed was Rs. 11,416-15-0. Against this order he took the usual appeals to the Sales Tax Authorities and after the appeals were rejected, he took a revision under s. 24 of the Act before the Board of Revenue, Bihar, where also he was unsuccessful. Under s. 25 of the Act, he applied for referring 6 questions of law to the High court and those questions were as follows-  Whether upon the true construction of the agreement of 1945 between the State Government and the assessee which had been acted upon and not reviewed, the Department was legally entitled to tax petitioner on his gross turnover instead of 66 2/3 of the same  Whether Member, Board of Revenue, having held that in the circumstances the petitioner had prima facie bona fide grounds for his belief that the arrangement which the Department had entered into, would continue could legally hold, that the petitioner was not entitled to be assessed in terms of the said arrangement ? Whether in the facts and circumstances of the case, it is open to the Department to challenge the continuance of the arrangement arrived at between the State Government and the petitioner especially so when the State Government by its own acts or omissions misled the petitioner into maintaining his accounts in a manner prejudicial to the petitioners claim for deductions on account of sale of tax free goods during the period ? Whether in the facts and circumstances of the case, the petitioner was entitled to the entire deduction on account of sale of meat and fish in terms of Notification No. 5564 Ft. dated 30-3-49 under section 6 of the Bihar Sales Act. 1947 ? Whether the Member Board of Revenue having held that meat and fish mentioned in Notification No. 5564 Ft. dated 30- 3-49 under section 6 of the Bihar Sales Tax, Act. 1947, included boiled meat and fish and cold meat and fish, could legally hold that meat and fish cooked otherwise were not covered in the terms of said notification ? Whether in terms of the Notification No. 5564 Ft. dated 30-3-49 cold meat and fish and boiled meat and fish could be distinguished from other preparation of meat and fish ? But the Board of Revenue referred the following question to the High Court under s. 6- Whether the following forms of meat and fish are covered by Notification No. 5564 Ft. dated 30-3-49, issued under section 6 of the Bihar Sales Tax Act, 1947 ? Raw (i.e. uncooked in any way) meat or fish. Boiled meat and fish, cooled or uncooled, meant for sale or consumption outside the petitioners premises. Fish or meat, which has been boiled or cooked in some other way served as separate or part of a dish outside the petitioners premises as separate dishes or part of a menu. Fish or meat, which has been boiled or cooked in some other way, served as separate dishes or part of a dish outside the petitioners premises. The High court reframed the question as follows- Whether the petitioner was entitled to exemption under Notification No. 5564 Ft., dated 30th March, 1949, issued under section 6 of the Bihar Sales Act, 1947 with regard to the sales of the preparations of meat and fish e.g., meat curry and fish curry served as separate dishes, or as part of the menu, at lunch or dinner, at the petitioners premises or outside ? and answered it against the appellant. It is against the order of the Board of Revenue that the appellant has come in appeal by special leave but has not appeared against the judgment and order of the High Court.This Court in M s. Chimmonalall Rameshwarlall Commissioner of Income-tax (Central) Calcutta (1) held that in cases where a reference is made to the High Court and the appeal is brought only against the order of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal then the Supreme Court, if it interfered, would in fact be setting aside the judgment of the High Court without there being an appeal to this Court, and that this Court could not bypass the normal procedure which was to be adopted for the purpose. In a later Judgment in Chandi Prasad Chokhani v. State of Bihar (2)a similar view was taken that as the assessee had not obtained Special Leave in respect of any of the orders passed by the High Court under s. 25 those orders became final and binding and the assessee could not be allowed to bypass or go behind the orders of the High Court and such exercise would be particularly inadvisable in a case where the result may be a conflict of the decision of two courts of competent jurisdiction, which was contrary to the object of ss. 23, 24 and 25 of the Act. In this view of the law the appellant is not entitled to agitate the correctness or otherwise of the decision given by the Tribunal in regard to the questions which we agitated before the High Court and were decided against the appellant and against which no appeal has been brought. But he submits that there are three other questions which also arise, and on which the appellant wanted a reference to the High Court but which were not referred. It was open to the appellant to apply to the High Court for a reference under s. 25. That the appellant did not do, and it has not been shown that there was any such breach of the rules of natural justice or violation of any principal of law which would be a good ground for our interference direct with the orders of the Board of Revenue in an appeal under Art. 136 of the Constitution.DECISION ??"
135.0,Tax,"Appeal from the judgment and order dated March 20, 1959, of the Bombay High Court at Nagpur in Special Civil Application No. 322 of 1958. S. Bobde, and Ganpat Rai, for the appellant. C. Mathur and P. D. Menon, for the respondents. 1962. March 15. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by GAJENDRAGADKAR, J.-On the 26th July, 1958, the Collector of Central Excise, Nagpur, passed an order directing absolute confiscation of five bars of gold weighing 290.6 Tolas found in the possession of the appellant Pukhraj and imposing upon him a personal penalty of Rs. 25,000/- under s. 167 (8) of the Sea Customs Act, 1878 read with a. 19 of the said Act and s. 23-A of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1947. Aggrieved by the said order, the appellant filed a writ petition in the High Court of Bombay at Nagpur under Arts. 226 and 227 of the Constitution on September 15, 1958. By this petition, the appellant claimed a writ of Certiorari or other appropriate writ or order quashing the impugned order. It was urged by him in support of his petit-ion, inter alia, that s. 178A of the Sea Customs Act was unconstitutional in that it infringed the appellants fundamental right under Art. 19 (1) (1) and (g) of the Constitution. It was also. urged that on the merits, the said impugned order was not justified by the relevant statutory provisions of the Sea Customs Act read with the Foreign Exchange, Regulation Act. The High Court rejected the appellants challenge to the validity of s. 178A and held that the order directing the confiscation of five bars of gold was valid. The High Court, however, took the view that the direction issued by the Collector of Central Excise imposing a personal penalty of Rs. 25,000/- On the appellant was invalid and so, the said direction was sot aside and a writ issued in that behalf. The appellant then applied for and obtained a certificate from the said High Court and it is with the said certificate that he has come to this Court for challenging the correctness of the order passed by the High Court by which the confiscation of gold in question has been held to be valid. The main point on which the certificate was granted by the High Court to the appellant was in regard to the constitutional validity of a. 178A. That question has, in the meanwhile, been decided by this Court on September 25, 1961, in Civil Appeals Nos. 408 to 410 of 1960 and other companion appeals. The judgment of the constitutional Bench dealingwith those appeals has upheld the validity of s.178A and so, the principal point which the appellant wanted to raise before this Court is now concluded against him. For the appellant, Mr. Bobde has, however, urged three other contentions before us in support of his case that the confiscation of gold is not justified. Before dealing with these contentions, it is necessary to mention very briefly the relevant facts which led to the confiscation of gold. The appellant is a goldsmith by profession and owns a gold and silver shop at Rajnandgaon in Madhya Pradesh. On October 25, 1956, whilst he was travelling by the passenger train from Calcutta on the CalcuttaNagpur route, he was searched at Raigarh railway station and found to be in possession of five pieces of gold bullion weighing 290.6 tolas valued at Rs. 29,835/- approximately. The said gold was then seized by the Officer concerned acting on a reasonable belief that it was smuggled gold, and notice was issued against the appellant on May 20, 1957, calling upon him to show cause why action should not be taken against him for having contravened the notification issued by the Government of India No. 12 (11)-F.1/48 dated August 26, 1948 under the foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1947 read with s.23A of the said Act and s.19 of the Sea Customs Act and punishable under item (8) of s.167 of the Sea Customs Act. The appellant sent a reply and thereupon, the Collector of Central Excise held an enquiry. At the enquiry the appellant appeared by counsel and examined four witnesses in support of his plea that he was in possession of gold Which belonged to him and which was not smuggled gold at all. Documentary evidence in the form of account books was also produced by the appellant in sup. port of his plea. The Collector of Central Excise disbelieved the evidence adduced by the appellant and came to the conclusion that the presumption arising under s.178 of the Sea Customs Act had not .been rebutted by the appellant and so, he proceeded to pass the impugned order confiscating gold and imposing on the appellant a personal penalty of Rs.25,000/-. It is in the light of these facts that the three contentions raised by Mr. Bobde fall to be, considered in the present appeal. The first argument raised in support of the appeal is that the confiscation of gold is not justified under s.167(8) because it has been found by the High Court that the appellant is not a person concerned in the offence of importation of the said gold. It appears that in dealing with the question as to whether the personal penalty imposed upon the appellant is valid or not, the High Court has relied on two considerations. It has held that the jurisdiction of the officer to impose a personal penalty was confined to the imposition of a penalty only up to Rs.1000/-and no more, and in support of this conclusion, the High Court relied on certain observations made by this Court in F.N.Roy v. Collector of Customs, Calcutta(1). This question has been recently considered by this Court in M s. Ranchhoddas Atmaram v. The Union of India(2) and it has been held that the language in item (8) of s.167 is clear and it permits the imposition of a penalty in excess of Rs.1000/- and that must be given effect to whatever may have been the intention in other provisions. So, it is clear that the High Court was in error in taking the view that under section 167(8), it was not within the jurisdiction of the Collector of Central Excise to impose a penalty exceeding Rs. 1000/-. The High Court has also held that the appellant was not shown to have been concerned with the importation of the smuggled gold, though he was found in possession of it and this finding, according to the High Court, justified the conclusion that a personal penalty could not be imposed on him. We are not called upon to consider in the present appeal the correctness or propriety of this conclusion because there is no appeal by the respondent Collector of Central Excise challenging this part of the High Courts order. Basing himself on the finding of the High Court that the appellant was not concerned in the importation of ,smuggled gold, Mr. Bobde argues that even the goods cannot be confiscated under s.167(8). In our opinion, this argument is clearly misconceived. Section 167(8) clearly provides, inter alia, that if (1) 1957 S.C.R.1 151 at p.1158, (2) 1961 3 S.C.R. 718. any goods, the importation of which is for the time being prohibited or restricted by or under Chapter IV of the Act, be imported into India contrary to such prohibition or restriction, such goods shall be liable to confiscation. If s.167(8) applies, then there can be no doubt that as soon as it is shown that certain goods have been imported contrary to the statutory prohibition or restriction, they are liable to confiscation and the confiscation of the said goods is not based on the fact that they are necessarily found with a person who was concerned with their importation. Therefore, once s.167(8) is hold to be applicable, the validity of the order directing the confiscation of the smuggled goods is beyond any challenge. The next question to consider is whether s.167(8) applies to the facts of this case, and that takes us to the relevant notification issued by the Government of India in 1948. This notification imposed restrictions on import of gold and silver and it has been issued under s.8(1) of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1947. The effect of this notification, inter alia, is that except with the general or special permission of the Reserve Bank, no person shall bring or send into India from any place outside India any gold, coin gold bullion. gold sheets or gold ingot, whether refined or not. Thus, bringing into India gold from outside is prohibited by this notification unless the said gold is brought with the general or special permission of the Reserve Bank. Section 23 of the said Act provides for penalty and procedure in respect of contravention of its provisions and of rules, orders or directions issued thereunder. Section 23-A provides that without prejudice to the provisions of s. 23 or to any other provision contained in the said Act, the restrictions imposed by sub-s.(1) and (2) of s. 8 shall be deemed to have been imposed under s. 19 of the Sea Customs Act, and all the provisions or that Act shall have effect accordingly, except that s. 183 thereof shall have effect as if for the word shall therein the word ,may was substituted. It would, thus be noticed that the combined effect of the aforesaid provisions of the two Acts and the relevant notification is that the notification of 1948 has the force of a notification issued under s. 19 of the Sea Customs Act, and in consequence, gold imported in contravention of the said notification is liable to be seized under . 1.78 of the said Act and renders the person in possession of the said gold liable for proceedings under s.167(8) of the said Act and since the matter falls to be considered under the, relevant provisions of the Sea Customs Act, s. 178A is also applicable. This position is not disputed. Now s. 178A places the burden of proving that the goods are not smuggled goods on the person from whose possession the said goods are seized where it appears that the said goods are seized under the provisions of the Sea Customs Act in the reasonable belief that they are smuggled goods. Once it is shown that the goods were seized in the manner contemplated by the first part of s. 178A, it would be for the appellant to prove that the goods were not smuggled goods and since it has been held by the Collector of Central Excise that the appellant had not discharged the onus imposed on him by s. 178A, the statutory presumption remained unrebutted and so, the goods must be dealt with on the basis that they are smuggled goods. As soon as we reach this conclusion, it follows that under s. 167(8) of the Sea Customs Act, the said goods are liable to confiscation. That is the view taken by the High Court when it rejected the appellants prayer for a writ quashing the order of confiscation passed by the Collector of Central Excise in respect of the gold in question, and we see no reason to interfere with it. The next argument urged by Mr. Bobde is that certain witnesses whose evidence was recorded by the Collector of Central Excise in the enquiry before him, were not produced for cross-examination by the appellant. In our opinion, there is no substance in this argument. This complaint relates to the evidence of Anwar, Marotrao and his brother Rambhau. These three persons, it is alleged made their statements in the absence of the appellant. It was, however, stated before the High Court by Mr. Abhyankar for the department that Anwar was, in fact, examined in the presence of the appellants counsel and the appellants counsel did not cross-examine him. This statement was accepted by Mr. Sorabji who appeared for the appellant and so, no valid complaint can be made that Anwar gave evidence in the absence of the appellant and the appellant bad no opportunity to cross-examine him. Then, as regards Marotrao and Rambhau, their statements were intended to show that the appellants case that he had got the gold melted through them was not true. At the enquiry, the appellant gave up this stand and did not adhere to his earlier version that the gold in question had been melted with the assistance of the said two witnesses. Since it became unnecessary to consider that plea because of the change of attitude adopted by the appellant, it was hardly necessary to allow the appellant to cross-examine the said two witnesses. Their version on the point was no longer inconsistent with the subsequent case set up by the appellant. Therefore there is no substance in the argument that the enquiry held by the Collector of Central Excise was conducted unfairly and the procedure adopted at the said enquiry was inconsistent with the requirements of natural justice. The last contention raised by Mr. Bobde was that there is nothing on record to show that the seizure of gold from the appellant had been affected by the officer concerned acting on a reasonable belief that the said gold was smuggled. It would be recalled that S. 178A of the Sea Customs Act requires that before the burden can be imposed on the appellant to show that the goods in question were not smuggled, it has to be shown that the goods had been seized under the said Act and in the reasonable belief that they are smuggled goods. The argument is that the question as to whether there was a reasonable belief or not is justiceable, and since there is no material on the record to show that the belief could have been reasonable, the statutory presumption cannot be raised. In our opinion, this argument is not well-founded. There are two broad features of this seizure which cannot be igno- red. The first feature on which the officer relied is supplied by the quantity of gold in question. It was found that the appellant was carrying on his person five pieces of gold bullion weighing as much as 290.6 tolas. This large quantity of gold valued at nearly Rs. 30,000/- itself justified a reasonable belief in the mind of the officer that the gold may be smuggled. In that connection, it may not be irrelevant to remember that the said officer had received positive information in the month of September, 1956, regarding the smuggling of gold by the appellant. That is why he was intercepted by the officer on the 25th October, 1956, at the Raigarb railway station at 16.30 hours. Then the other fact on which the reasonable belief can be founded is the suspicious circumstances of the appellants journey. The appellant was found travelling without a Railway ticket and his explanation as to how he came to be. in the said passenger train is obviously untrue. A person carrying a, large quantity of gold and found travelling without a ticket may well have raised a reasonable belief in the mind of the officer that the gold was smuggled. The object of travelling without a ticket must have been to conceal the fact that the appellant had travelled all the way from Calcutta at which place the gold must have been smuggled. The story subsequently mentioned by the appellant about his journey to Tatanagar which has been disbelieved brings into bold belief the purpose which the appellant had in mind in travelling without a ticket. After-all-, when we are dealing with a question as to whether the belief in the mind of the Officer who effected the seizure was reasonable or not, we are not sitting in appeal over the decision of the said officer. All that we can consider is whether there is ground which prima facie justifies the said reasonable belief. That being so, we do not think there is any substance in the argument that the seizure was effected without a reasonable belief and so is outside section 178A.DECISION ??"
136.0,Tax,"Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated February 3, 1961, of the Madhya Pradesh High Court in M. P. No. 139 of 1960. C. Chatterjee and D. N. Mukherjee, for appellants. Sen and 1. N. Shroff, for respondent No. 1. P. Maheshwari, for respondent No. 2. 1962. April 16. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by AYYANGAR, J.-By a communication dated April 5, 1930, from the Secretary to the Government of the Central Provinces addressed to the Commissioner Jabalpur Division, certain Nazul land was made available to the Municipal Committee of Jabalpur. In this letter the Secretary Stated I am directed by the Governor in Council with the previous sanction of the Government of India to communicate the following orders of the Government of the Central Provinces - Under Section 38(1)(f) of the Central Provinces Municipalities Act, 1922, Government is pleased to transfer to the Municipal Committee, Jubbiilpore, free of premium and ground rent nazul land measuring of the Jabbulpore town. The land shall vest in the Municipal Committee subject to the following conditions The land shall be used only for the purpose of a garden and no part of it shall be used for any other purpose without the previous sanction of the Local Government. If condition 1 is broken the land shall be liable to be divested under section 38(2) and resumed by Government .and no compensation whatsoever shall be payable to the Municipal Committee upon such resumption. If the land. is resumed by Government for any Government purpose the provisions of Section 38(3) will apply. Sub-sections (2) (3) of s. 38 referred to ran 38. (2) The State Government may, by notification, direct that any property which has vested in the committee shall cease to be so vested, and thereupon the property speci- fied in the notification shall cease to be so vested and the State Government may pass such orders as it thinks fit regarding the disposal and management of such property. Where any immovable property is transferred, otherwise than by sales, by the State Government to a committee, for public purpose, it shall be deemed to be a condition of such transfer, unless specially provided to the contrary, that, should the property be at any time resumed by the Government, the compensation payable therefor shall notwith- standing any thing to the contrary in the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (1 of 1894), in no case exceed the amount, if any, paid to the Govern- ment for the transfer, together with the cost or the present value, whichever shall be less, of any buildings created or other works executed on the land by the committee. The land thus obtained was being used by the Municipal Committee in accordance with the condition of the transfer as a public garden. The Central Provinces Berar Municipalities Act, 1922 was repealed by the City of Jabalpur Corporation Act, 1948 (M.III of 1950). Under this later enactment the Municipal Committee was substituted by the Jabalpur Corporation, the appellant before us and all properties-movable and immovable-which were previously vested in the Municipal Committee were transferred to and vested in the Corporation (vide s. 71 of the Jabalpur Corporation Act), and by reason of the vesting, the appellant was in enjoyment of the transferred property. A hostel or boarding house of a public institution-the Hitkarni Mahavidyalaya had been located in a building constructed to the north of the Public Garden maintained by the Corporation. A public road ran to the south of the Public Garden and as there was not a proper and convenient access from the Boarding-house to the public road, the authorities of the Mahavidyalaya approached the State Government to obtain for them a narrow strip of land about 20 ft. wide at the eastern extremity of the Public Garden for the purpose of laying a public road which would provide this access. The Government considered this request reasonable and forwarded this request of the Mahavidyalaya, with a covering letter of their own dated April 28, 1959, to the Corporation for being complied with.- The request however was not acceded to and thereafter on February 11, 1960, the Government of Madhya Pradesh issued a notification under s. 81 of the Jabalpur Corporation Act notifying that the strip of land needed for making a road measuring 3, 940 sq. ft. stood divested from the Corporation., .Section 81 runs in these terms  The Provincial Government may resume any immovable property, transferred to the Corporation by itself or by any local authority, where such property is required for a public purpose, without payment of any compensation other than the amount paid by the Corporation for such transfer and the market value at the date of resumption of any buildings or works subsequently reacted or executed thereon by the Corporation with the intention that such buildings or works should be permanent Provided that compensation need not be paid for buildings or works constructed or erected in contravention of the terms of the transfer. (The expression Provincial Government was amended so as to read State Government by the Adaptation of Laws Order). Complaining that this notification was illegal and beyond the jurisdiction of the State Government the Jabalpur Corporation moved the High Court of Madhya Pradesh for relief under Art-. 826 of the Constitution praying for the issue of the writ of mandamus quashing the notification of the government as without jurisdiction and forbidding the enforcement of that order. This was opposed both by the State of Madhya Pradesh as well as the Hitkarini Sabha and the learned Judges dismissed this petition. An application for a certificate of fitness for appeal to this Court filed by the Corporation was also dismissed and therefore the present appeal has been filed by special leave obtained under Art. 136 of the Constitution. The submission of Mr. Chatterji-learned Counsel for the appellant-was naturally directed to showing that the reasoning adopted by the learned judges of the High Court was erroneous. The reasoning was briefly as follows The learned Judges assumed, accepting a submission made on behalf of the appellant-Corporation during the arguments on the writ petition, that the authority which effected the transfer of the property to the Municipal Committee of Jabalpur by the order which we have set out as the opening of this judgment was not the Government of Central Provinces Berar but the Central Government. Starting from this premise, they concluded that the notification could not be sustained under the terms of s. 81. Section 81, it will be seen, empowers the State Government to resume immovable property transferred to the Corporation by itself when such property is required for a public purpose. If the property in question had been transferred by the Central Government, the argument ran that s. 81 was inapplicable. It should be added that both in the basic assumption that it was the Central and not the Local Government the predecessor of the State Government that had effected the transfer, as well as in the further consequence that the exercise of the power under s. 81 of the Corporation Act was ineffective, the learned Judges were aided by concessions accepting the correctness of this position which appear to have been made by the Deputy Advocate General who represented the State before them., We shall have occasion to refer to this aspect later. Meanwhile to proceed with the reasoning of the learned Judges, s. 81 being assumed not to be available to sustain the impugned notification, the learned Counsel for the State appears to have relied on the provisions of s. 38 of the Act of 1922 as enabling the State Government to resume the land, and this notwithstanding that by the Jabalpur Corporation Act III of 1950 the entirety of the C.  Berar Municipalities Act of 1922 including s. 38 bad been expressly repealed. The learned Judges considered that this was possible by reason of a saving contained in s. 3 (1) of the Jabalpur Corporation Act which reads- 3. (1) All debts and obligations incurred, all contracts entered into with and all matters and things engaged to be done by or for, the Municipality of Jubbulpore, before this Act comes into force shall be deemed to have been incurred, entered into with or engaged to be done by, or for, the Corporation as constituted under this Act. Mr. Chatterji-learned Counsel for the appellant Corporation submitted to us that the learned Judges of the High Court bad wrongly applied the saving in s. 3 (1) of Act III of 1940 to sustain the resumption of land under the impugned notification. He consider, however, that in view of our conclusion that the impugned notification fell clearly within the power vested in State Government under s. 81 of the Jabalpur Corporation Act, it is not necessary to pronounce upon the correctness of the submissions made to us on the construction of s. I (1) of that Act, There could not be any dispute that if the authority that had transferred the property covered by the impugned notification, to the Municipal Committee of Jabalpur was the Government of Central Provinces Berar, the right of the suceessor-Government viz. the State Government of Madhya Pradesh to take over the land from the Corporation for the purpose of forming a public road would manifestly be within their power under a. 81. That the Corporation of Jabalpur was the successor-in-title to the Municipal Committee of Jabalpur and. that the property which- was vested in the Municipal Committee of Jabalpur was transferred to and became vested in the appellant Corporation under s. 71 of the Jabalpur Corporation Act, were never in dispute and indeed formed the very basis of the appellants petition to the High Court. If any particular property had vested in the Municipal Committee subject to its being divested in particular contingencies, that the property in the hands of the Corporation would be held subject to the same obligations or disabilities could also not be in controversy. Nor could it be contested that the making of a public road is a public purpose for which land may be resumed by the State under s.  What we desire to point out is that if the State of Madhya Pradesh was or must be deemed to have been the transferee of the property under the communication dated April 5, 1930, the validity of the notification under s. 81 could not be challenged. As we have pointed out earlier, the learned Judges proceeded, however on the assumption that it was not the Government of C. P. Berar but the Central Government that was the transferrer of the land in question. There was, however, no basis upon which the learned Judges could have rested this assumption. In the first place, in the writ petition by which the appellant-Corporation challenged the validity of the notification it did not deny the fact that it was the Government of C. P. Berar that had effected the transfer, and, in fact, the allegations in the petition proceeded on the basis that it was the State Government that had done so but the contention raised was that on a proper construction of is. 81 it applied only to transfers made after the Jubbulpore Corporation Act, 1948 came into force- an untenable contention which has not been persisted in. The question as to who a transferor is obviously a question of fact or at best a mixed question of law and fact and when a party in a writ petition does not allege any such fact, it stands to reason that he ought not to be permitted to travel beyond the facts stated, at the stage of the arguments, To confine a party to his pleadings, particularly to his allegations as regards facts is dictated not merely by the need for orderliness in these proceedings but for avoiding surprise to the other party and consequent injustice resulting therefrom. Save in exceptional cases, parties should be held strictly to their pleadings and if owing to discovery of new matter or grounds, there is need to add to or to modify the allegations either in the petition or in the counter- affidavit, the Court should insist on formal amendments being effected, for this would enable each party to state its case with precision and definiteness and the other side would have a proper opportunity to know this case and meet it with appropriate defences. This salutary rule was not adhered to in this case, and the departure from the pleadings which the appellant was permitted to adopt during the course of its arguments before the High Court has led to injustice because thereby the Counsel for the State who was apparently not prepared, to meet an argument not raised in the petition, made submissions at the spur of the moment which were not justified by the true state of affairs. In our opinion, on the allegations made in the petition by the appellant Corporation it ought not to have been permitted to put forward a case that the State Government was not the transferor of the property and the learned Judges of the High Court should have proceeded on the basis of the pleadings in the case. Apart from this question of pleading, we consider that there is no merit in the contention even otherwise. We have already set out the terms by which the transfer of the land was communicated to the Municipal Committee. The preamble recites that is what being communicated is the order of the Government of the Central Provinces. The words of conveyance are in the second paragraph and they read Under section 38(1)(f) of the Central Provinces Municipalities Act, 1922 Government is pleased to transfer to the Municipal Committee . The expression Government here obviously, in the context, means the Government of the Central Provinces. Paragraph 2 which specifies what should happen if the condition on which the land has been granted should be broken, states The land shall be liable to be. divested under s. 38 (2) and resumed by Government . Government here again obviously is the Government of the Central Provinces a construction reinforced if one looked at the sub-section referred to. Further, in Condition 3 which speaks of what was to happen if the land was resumed by Government for any Government purpose the reference to Government again is to the State Government. On the terms of the document therefore it was the Government of the Central Provinces that made the grant-the predecessor of the State Government. We find therefore that there is no factual foundation for the submission which was apparently made before the High Court that the transfer in the present case was by the Central Government. No doubt, the communication refers to the fact that previous to making the grant the Government of C. P. Berar had obtained the approval of the Central Government, but that was merely a matter of administrative arrangement between the Central and Local Governments which is totally irrelevant for determining the identity of the Government which made the grant. Besides, the corporation having accepted the grant from the State Government was obviously estopped from contending that the land of which it continued in possession under that grant was not one by the State Government or that the State Government had not the authority to make the grant. If such contention is both not open to the Corporation and not tenable on the merits., it would follow that the impugned notification was fully justified by the, provisions under s. 81 of the Jabalpur Corporation Act. DECISION ??"
137.0,Tax, An Industrial unit run by M s. Diamond Marbles Pvt. Ltd respondent No 4 was brought to sale in terms of Section 29 of the State Financial Corporation Act 1951 for short the State Act by Rajasthan Financial Corporation respondent No 3. Appellant before us participated in auction and its bid having been accepted took possession of the said unit on 28 8 1987 pursuant to the agreement entered into between them. On 4 12 1987 the Additional Collector of Central Excise adjudicated in a proceeding arising out of show cause notice issued under Section 11A of the Central Excise Act to respondent No 4 in relation to certain goods that are said to have been removed between 13 8 1986 and 23 8 1986 and excise duty of Rs 1 04 586.17 and penalty of Rs 3 lakhs was levied and demanded.A letter was sent by the Central Excise Department to the appellant demanding a sum of Rs 4 07 291.75 pursuant to the adjudication order made against respondent No 4 The appellant in his letter to the Department contended that it had no liability to pay the excise dues of respondent No 4. The Department not having acceded to it a writ petition was filed in the High Court challenging the recovery proceedings initiated by the Department. However the said amount was paid. In the writ petition several contentions were raised including the question that the liability is only that of respondent No 4 and not of the appellant that appellant having taken over the unit from the third respondent had no liability to pay the excise dues that Rule 230 2 of the Central Excise Rules 1944 has no application to the present case. The High Court disagreed with these submissions and took the view that in terms of the said Rule it is open to the Department to proceed against the plants and machinery of the owner from whom it was transferred and made it clear that it is open to the appellant to agitate against the erstwhile owner respondent No 3 but had to pay the dues to the Department and thereby dismissed the writ petition. Hence this appeal by special leave.In this appeal Ms. Radha Rangaswamy learned Counsel for the appellant very strenuously contended that in view of Section 46B of the State Act it would prevail over the Central Excise Act and relied upon the decision of this Court in Sitani Textiles Fabrics P Ltd v. Asstt. C of Cus C.E Hyderabad 1999 106 E.L.T 296. She submitted that as the State Act is a special enactment and Central Excise Act is a general enactment the State Act would prevail over the same. It is brought to our notice that this aspect is under consideration in another matter before this Court. It is also submitted that as held in N.B Sanjana Assistant Collector of Central Excise Bombay and Ors v. The Elphinstone Spinning and Weaving Mills Co. Ltd 1978 2 E.L.T J 399 the penalty was not attracted in the present case at all. She also relied upon the decision of this Court in Isha Marbles v Bihar State Electricity Board and Anr to contend that in case of sales effected under Section 29 1 of the State Act the recovery of dues of previous owner from the auction purchaser could not be made.Now taking the last contention first we may notice that this Court in Isha Marbles considered the scope of Section 24 of the Electricity Act and held that there is no charge over the property in question and when a premises comes to be owned or purchased by the auction purchaser he cannot be called upon to clear the past arrears when such purchaser seeks supply of electric energy or it is made clear in that decision that what matters is the contract entered into by the erstwhile consumer with the Board and the Board cannot seek the enforcement of contractual liability against the third party. Therefore this decision in Isha Marbles cannot be taken advantage of by the appellant at all in this case.In this case the liability arises under the Central Excise Act and Rule 230 2 of the Central Excise Rules. The said Rule clearly indicates that it is a mode of recovery of the excise dues from the assets owned by a predecessor and on his liabilities being assessed could be recovered even from the successor.The argument advanced by the appellant that sale having taken place under the State Act free of encumbrances and the transferor s rights or liabilities cannot be that of transferee does not hold good. Section 29 2 of the State Act makes it clear that the property pledged mortgaged hypothecated or assigned to the Financial Corporation can be brought to sale and such a sale if resulted in transfer of property shall vest in the successor all rights in the property transferred as if the transfer has been made by the owner of the property. When sale made by the corporation is deemed to be a sale made by the owner of the property necessarily Rule 230 2 of the Central Excise Rules would be attracted.We are not impressed with the argument that the State Act is a special enactment and the same would prevail over the Central Excise Act. Each of them is a special enactment and unless in the operation of the same any conflict arises this aspect need not be examined. In this case no such conflict arises between the corporation and the Excise Department. Hence it is unnecessary to examine this aspect of the matter.DECESION ?
