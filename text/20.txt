395, 396 and 397 IPC:
395. Punishment for dacoity.--Whoever commits dacoity shall be punished with 1[imprisonment for
life], or with rigorous impris−onment for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be
liable to fine
396. Dacoity with murder.--If any one of five or more persons, who are conjointly committing
dacoity, commits murder in so committing dacoity, every one of those persons shall be punished
with death, or 1[imprisonment for life], or rigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend to
ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.

397. Robbery, or dacoity, with attempt to cause death or grievous hurt.--If, at the time of
committing robbery or dacoity, the offender uses any deadly weapon, or causes grievous hurt to any
person, or attempts to cause death or grievous hurt to any person, the imprisonment with which
such offender shall be punished shall not be less than seven years.
22. According to the Oxford Dictionary, Dacoity means - an act of violent robbery committed by an
armed gang. There is no difference between robbery and dacoity except in the number of offenders.
Robbery is dacoity, if the persons committing robbery are five or more in number. The offence of
dacoity consists in the cooperation of five or more persons to commit or attempt to commit robbery.
It is necessary that all the persons should share the common intention of committing robbery.
On a plain reading of Section 391, IPC it would appear that in order that a dacoity can be said to
have been committed, it is necessary that five or more persons conjointly commit a robbery or
attempt to commit robbery. If a robbery was committed, the dacoits would have the booty with
them, but if the matter rested only with an attempt to commit a robbery there would be no question
of the dacoits having any booty with them.
There are three ingredients in Dacoity:
(a). The accused commit or attempt to commit robbery;
(b). Persons committing or attempting to commit robbery and persons present and aiding must not
be less than five;
(c) All such persons should act conjointly.
The word conjointly refers to united or concerted action of five or more persons participating in the
act of committing the offence. In other words, five or more persons should be concerned in the
commission of the offence and they should commit or attempt to commit robbery.
23. From perusal of the above extracted sections, it is evident that for the purpose of commission of
dacoity, five or more persons are conjointly required to commit the said offence. In the present case,
eight persons have been made an accused for committing the said offence. During trial appellant
nos. 4 to 7 have been acquitted from the charge of sections 395/397 IPC and they have been
convicted under section 412 IPC only. Further the trial court held guilty to the appellant nos. 1, 2
and 3 only for committing the offence of dacoity but perusal of the above extracted sections and
discussions reflects that for commission of dacoity five or more persons are required, therefore, the
trial court has committed manifest error in holding the appellant nos. 1, 2 and 3 guilty for
committing dacoity.
24. Further the trial court has committed error in holding the guilty to the appellant nos. 4 to 7
because of the fact that when dacoity has not been proved against the appellants, then without
connecting the recovered ornaments with any crime , they cannot be held guilty under section 412
IPC, therefore, the appellants deserves to be acquitted.

25. In view of the above discussions, this Court is of the view that the arguments advanced on behalf
of the appellants have substance and the present appeal deserves to be allowed and the survival
appellants deserve to be acquitted from the charges levelled against them.
26. It is relevant to mention here that during the pendency of the present appeal, appellant no.1
Gopali and appellant no.4 Jang Bahadur reported to have died and on their behalf vide order dated
16.08.2017 the already stands abated.
27. In view of the facts and circumstances stated above, the appeal is allowed. The surviving
appellant nos.2, 3, 5, 6 and 7, namely, Ram Kumar, Chhedi, Ganga Prasad, Shri Pal and Om Prakash
are acquitted from the charges under sections 395/397, 412 IPC. The appellants are on bail. Their
bail bonds are cancelled. The sureties are discharged from their liabilities. They need not surrender,
