7.

Learned Single Judge by its order dated 10.06.2020

dismissed the writ petition. Learned Single Judge held
that the appellant being subsequent purchaser is liable
to pay the penalty amount. Learned Single Judge noticed
that there being no interim order in SLP(C)

Diary No.

30539 of 2017 pending in this Court he was liable to
pay the penalty amount. The High Court also took the
view

that

payment

of

penalty

by

post

dated

cheques

cannot be approved by the High Court. Insofar as notice

6

dated 04.06.2020 issued by the Municipal Corporation,
the High Court took the view that at that time no
interference

was

called

for

and

after

payment

of

penalty amount in toto, the appellant would be free to
apply afresh for building permission again whereafter
the Municipal authorities are directed to reconsider
the application for building permission. With the above
discussion, the writ petition was dismissed. Aggrieved
by the judgment of the High Court, the appellant has
filed this appeal.

15. We have considered the submission of the parties
and perused the record.
16. In pursuance of the order of the Collector dated
22.09.2008, Trustees of H.C. Dhanda Trust were liable
to deposit stamp duty as well as penalty.

In

SLP(C)

Diary No.30539 of 2017 the interim order granted by

14

this Court on 10.11.2017 having not been complied with
there was no interim order operating and the Trustees
of H.C. Dhanda Trust were liable to deposit the stamp
duty and penalty. Although deficiency of stamp duty was
deposited through the Treasury Challan dated 01.11.2019
but the penalty was not deposited and only post dated
cheques

between

dates

25.02.2020

to

25.05.2020

were

submitted on behalf of the appellant and Jogesh Dhanda.
The High Court has rightly observed that facility to
deposit the penalty by post dated cheques cannot be
approved and the appellant being subsequent purchaser
was liable to deposit the amount of penalty which was
outstanding against the property and which was subject
matter

of

the

gift

deed

dated

21.04.2005.

The

High

Court has rightly not interfered with the order dated

17. We

by

our

order

of

the

date

passed

in

C.A.Nos……………………of 2020 (arising out of SLP(C)Nos.1097210973 of 2020) allowing the appeals partly, held:
“In result the appeals are allowed the
order
of
the
Collector
of
Stamps
dated
22.09.2008 is modified to the extent that
penalty
imposed
of
ten
times
of
Rs.12,80,97,000/- is modified into five times
penalty i.e. Rs.6,40,48,500/-. The appeals are
partly allowed to the above extent. “

18. The order of Collector dated 22.09.2008 having been
modified and the amount of penalty having been reduced
to

the

extent

of

half

of

the

ten

times

penalty,

respondents are to take steps in compliance to the said
order. Shri Sibal has submitted that total deposit as
on date by the appellant towards the penalty is about
RS.8.8 crores. The issue of penalty as imposed by the
order

of

the

Collector

of

Stamps

dated

22.09.2008

having already been decided by order of even date in
C.A.Nos……………………of 2020 (arising out of SLP(C)Nos.1097210973 of 2020) all the parties are to act in accordance
with the said judgment.

16

19. Now, we come to order dated 04.06.2020 which was
under challenge in the writ petition before the High
Court by which the Municipal Corporation, Indore has
cancelled the building permission granted earlier was
rejected.

The

High

Court

while

considering

the

aforesaid by its judgment in paragraph 8 has held:

“8. So far as order dated 4.6.2020 issued by
the Building Officer of Indore Municipal
Corporation is concerned, at this stage, no
interference is called for as the petitioner
has failed to deposit the penalty amount and
this fact was suppressed in the application
submitted for building permission. After the
deposit of the stamp duty and the penalty, the
Municipal
authorities
are
directed
to
reconsider
the
application
for
building
permission.”

20. The

above

observation

of

the

High

Court

amply

protects the rights of the appellant. In view of the
deposit made by the appellant towards the penalty, the
appellant

is

free

to

apply

for

building

permission

which is to be considered by the Municipal Corporation
as observed by the High Court in its judgment and order

17

dated 10.06.2020. Nothing more is required to be said
about the order dated 04.06.2020 issued by the Office
of the Municipal Corporation.

21. Now, we come to the submission of Shri Sibal with
regard to orders and notices issued by the Municipal
Corporation and other State Authorities subsequent to
filing of this appeal. The orders and notices issued by
the Municipal Corporation and other State Authorities
which

have

been

brought

on

record

by

the

IA

No.

72517/2020 are all subsequent actions which were not
subject matter of the writ petition before the High
Court and cannot be taken into consideration in this
appeal.

22. With

regard

to

subsequent

notices,

actions

and

orders, as noticed above, brought on record by IA noted
above the said issues cannot be entertained in this
appeal. We give liberty to the parties to seek such
remedy with regard to subsequent actions and orders as

18

permissible

in

law.

The

appeal

is

disposed

of

accordingly.
