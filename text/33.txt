4. The petitioners are the employees of a private school. The petitioner No. 1 is the Headmaster,
petitioner No. 2 is the teacher and the petitioner No. 3 is the Clerk in that school. It is alleged that
the petitioner No. 1 made a demand of bribe of an amount of Rs. 3000/- for issuing a transfer
certificate to the son of the complainant. It is alleged that pursuant to such demand money was
accepted by the petitioner No. 1 and the other two petitioners abetted commission of such crime.
Accordingly they were charge-sheeted for the offences punishable under sections 7, 12, 13(1)(d),
13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.
5. The petitioners submitted the application (Exhibit 9) seeking discharge primarily on the ground
that it is the Director of Education (Secondary and Higher Secondary) who has accorded sanction.
In fact initially the Investigating Officer had solicited a sanction to prosecute the petitioners from
the Management. However, it was rejected. Subsequently a fresh request was made to the Director
of Education, wp 360 2019.odt pursuant to which the sanction was accorded by referring to the
Government Resolution dated 05.11.2015. By the impugned order the learned Assistant Sessions
Judge rejected the application. Hence this writ petition.
6. The learned advocate for the petitioners submitted that in view of the provisions of Section 4 of
the The Maharashtra Employees of Private Schools (Conditions of Service) Regulation Act, 1977
(hereinafter referred to as M.E.P.S. Act) and the rules framed thereunder of the year 1981, the
petitioners being the employees of a private school, the Management which runs the school would
be the authority competent to remove them from the office within the meaning of clause (c) of Sub
section 1 of Section 19 of the Prevention of Corruption Act. It is pursuant to such a provision that
initially the sanction was solicited from the Management. The Management for the elaborate
reasons through its communication dated 30.11.2015 refused to accord the sanction. The learned
advocate would submit that without disclosing such rejection, pursuant to a Government Resolution
dated 05.11.2015 the investigating officer solicited the sanction from the Director of Education,
obtained a fresh favourable order and the prosecution was launched by filing the charge-sheet. The
learned advocate would submit that in fact when it is the wp 360 2019.odt Management which alone
was competent to remove the petitioners from the employment under the provisions of Section 4 of
the M.E.P.S. Act, the State Government could not have by issuing such a government resolution
superseded the statutory provision contained in Section 19 of the Prevention of Corruption Act. In
support of his submission he placed reliance on the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of
Rajasthan State Industrial Development & Investment Corporation Vs. Subhash Sindhi Cooperative
Housing Society & Oth. 2013 AIR (SC) 1226.
7. Thus according to the learned advocate, the Director of Education being not the competent
authority to remove the petitioners from the employment under the provisions of Section 4 of the
M.E.P.S. Act, he was not the competent authority to accord sanction under Section 19 of the
Prevention of Corruption Act to prosecute them. The Management having already refused to accord
sanction the petitioners could not have been prosecuted. The learned Assistant Sessions Judge has
failed to consider these aspects and by the impugned order refused to discharge them. The order is
not sustainable in law and may be quashed and set aside and the petitioners may be directed to be
discharged.

8. The learned A.P.P. submitted that though by virtue of the wp 360 2019.odt provisions of the
M.E.P.S. Act the Management is apparently the appointing authority and therefore removing
authority as well under section 4 of the M.E.P.S. Act, section 4A empowers the Director of Education
to initiate an enquiry against the employees of private schools and therefore it cannot be said that
the Director of Education could not be the competent authority. When the State Government has
issued the Government Resolution on 05.11.2015, i.e. even before the Management refused sanction
by the correspondence dated 30.11.2015, no fault can be found with the Investigating Officer in
approaching the Director of Education and soliciting sanction under Section 19 of the Prevention of
Corruption Act. The learned Assistant Sessions Judge therefore has correctly appreciated these facts
and has rightly rejected the application seeking discharge.
9. There is no dispute about the fact that the petitioners are the employees of the private school and
are governed by the M.E.P.S. Act. By virtue of provisions of section 4(6) of the M.E.P.S. Act, it is the
Management which alone is competent to suspend, dismiss or remove them from the employment.
By virtue of section 4A of the M.E.P.S. Act it is only when the Enquiry Committee enquiring into the
misconduct or misbehavour of an employee unreasonably exonerates him that it empowers the
Director of Education to direct the Management to wp 360 2019.odt impose penalty upon such an
employee. It further empowers the Director of Education to hold an enquiry if in spite of his
instructions the Management fails to initiate the action. By virtue of Section 4(6) of the M.E.P.S. Act
it is only the Management which has the power to remove its employees. The powers conferred upon
the Director are only contingent. Therefore it cannot be said that the Director of Education
independently derives any power under section 4A of the M.E.P.S. Act to remove an employee of a
private school. If such is the legal position, by virtue of Section 19 of the Prevention of Corruption
Act it would be the Management of a private school which alone would be competent to accord
sanction and nobody else i.e. not even the Director of Education can usurp that power.
10. True it is that initially the Anti-Corruption Bureau has solicited such a sanction under Section 19
of the Prevention of Corruption Act by addressing a letter to the Management on 21.10.2015 and the
Management has refused to accord sanction by its correspondence dated 30.11.2015. However in the
meantime the Government Resolution was issued on 05.11.2015 declaring that the Director of
Education would be the competent authority to accord sanction under Section 19 of the Prevention
of Corruption Act in respect of the employees of private schools. But having considered the wp 360
2019.odt provisions of Section 19 of the Prevention of Corruption Act which requires the sanction to
be accorded by an authority competent to remove the employee from his office and when in view of
the above discussion it has been found that it is the Management of such a private school which
alone has a power to remove such an employee by virtue of sub section 6 of Section 4 of the M.E.P.S.
Act, irrespective of the Government Resolution dated 05.11.2015, the Director of Education would
not be competent to accord the sanction under section 19 of the Prevention of Corruption Act.
Therefore without going into the intricate question as to whether the State Government could by an
executive order supersede the provisions of Section 19 of the Prevention of Corruption Act and
without examining its virus, it can be safely concluded on a conjoint reading of Section 19 (1)(c) of
the Prevention of Corruption Act and Sub Section 6 of Section 4 of the M.E.P.S. Act, that it is only
the Management of a private school which would be competent authority to remove an employee of
the school being run by it and the Director of Education will not have any such power. Consequently

the sanction to prosecute the petitioner accorded by the Director of Education stating to have
derived the power under the Government Resolution dated 05.11.2015 is indeed an illegality which
goes to the root of the matter and the very prosecution of the petitioners.
wp 360 2019.odt
11. In this regard, following observations of the Division Bench in paragraph No. 7 of the judgment
in case of Sau. Jyoti Ramesh Upase Vs. State of Maharashtra in Criminal Writ Petition No.
630/2013 in the judgment dated 21.20.2013 of the Bombay High Court (Nagpur Bench) are relevant
and binding :
"7. The service conditions of the petitioner are governed by the provisions of the
Maharashtra Employees of Private Schools (Conditions of Service) Regulation Act,
1977 hereinafter referred to as Act of 1977. The petitioner has been working as the
Head Mistress of the school and as per the provisions of Act of 1977 and the Rules
framed thereunder, the appointment of the petitioner has to be by the "Management"
as defined under Section 2(12)(c) of the Act of 1977. Consequently, the Authority
Competent to remove the petitioner from the service is the Management of the
school. The Investigating Officer had sought the sanction of the Management by the
communication dated 22nd October, 2008 but the Management had refused to grant
sanction for the prosecution of the petitioner by the resolution dated 3rd January,
2009. In our view the prosecution of the petitioner is illegal and cannot be continued
as it is without there being proper sanction as required by the provisions of Section
19(1)
(c) of the Act of 1977. The submission as made by the learned Additional Public
Prosecutor that the order dated 6th May, 2011 issued by the Principal Secretary is the
sufficient compliance of the provisions of Section 19(1)(c) of the Anti- Corruption Act,
1988 is misconceived and unsustainable in wp 360 2019.odt law. Though the school
is receiving grants from the State exchequer but as per the service conditions of the
petitioner, the Management of the School only is the Competent Authority to remove
the petitioner from the service. Under the provisions of the Act of 1977 and the Rules
framed thereunder the Principal Secretary of School Education and Sports
Department has no concern with the Management of the school in which the
petitioner is working and the Principal Secretary is not a Competent Authority to
remove the petitioner from her office."
12. Even if one is to examine the competence of the State Government to issue the Government
Resolution dated 05.11.2015, as has been rightly submitted by the learned advocate for the
petitioner by referring to the decision of the Supreme Court in case of Rajasthan State Industrial
Development & Investment Corporation Vs. Subhash Sindhi and particularly para No. 19, the State
Government had no power to override the provisions of Section 19 of the Prevention of Corruption
Act by issuing such executive instructions :

"19. Executive instructions which have no statutory force, cannot override the law.
Therefore, any notice, circular, guidelines etc. which runs contrary to statutory laws
cannot be enforced."
Therefore for this reason also, the sanction accorded by the Director of Education based on such
Government Resolution cannot be said to be wp 360 2019.odt a valid sanction under Section 19 of
the Prevention of Corruption Act.
13. For that matter, a coordinate bench of this Court at Nagpur bench in Criminal Revision
Application No. 198 of 2018; Pranita Prakashrao Katewale Vs. The State of Maharashtra by the
judgment and order dated 10.07.2019 relying upon the decision in case of Jyoti Ramesh Upase
(supra) has considered this aspect in the light of Government Resolution dated 05.11.2015 and has
made following observations in para No. 15 and 16.
"15. In the backdrop of said position of law clarified by the aforesaid Judgments of
this Court, it cannot be said that sanction granted in the present case for prosecution
against the applicant by the Director of Education was sustainable because it was in
terms of Government Resolution dated 05.11.2015. The said Government Resolution
is nothing but an executive instruction issued by the State and such executive
instructions can certainly not prevail over statutory provisions of the MEPS Act and
Rules and the aforesaid judgment of this Court, wherein it has been categorically laid
down that only the management of the school has the power and authority to grant
sanction for prosecution of a teacher or Headmistress for offences under the
provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. The said conclusion has been
given in the aforesaid judgment upon analysis of the provisions of the MEPS Act and
Rules and such position of law cannot be circumvented wp 360 2019.odt by issuing
executive instructions in the form of aforesaid Government Resolution dated
05.11.2015.
16. Thus, the contention raised on behalf of non- applicant State that the Director of
Education was competent to grant sanction for prosecution against the applicant in
the present case is wholly unsustainable and it is a fallacious argument raised on
behalf of the non- applicant State that as long as the Government Resolution dated
05.11.2015 exists and it is not set aside, the Director of Education is entitled to grant
sanction. This is because in no case can an executive instruction like the Government
Resolution dated 05.11.2015, prevail over the statutory provisions of the MEPS Act
and Rules and the Judgments rendered by this Court. Therefore, it is found that the
Court below committed a grave error in rejecting the contention raised on behalf of
the applicant regarding defective sanction as ground for discharge".
14. Apparently the decision in the case of Jyoti Ramesh Upase was not brought to the notice of
learned Assistant Sessions Judge. The decision in case of Pranita Prakashrao Katewale obviously
being decided later in point of time that could not have been brought to the notice of the learned
Assistant Sessions Judge. The impugned order therefore suffers from grave illegality and cannot

5

Anant Sheshrao Hadgekar And ... vs The State Of Maharashtra on 11 September, 2019

stand the legal scrutiny.
15. In view of such state of affairs, the impugned order is liable to wp 360 2019.odt be quashed and
set aside and the petitioners' application (Exhibit 9) seeking discharge deserves to be allowed by
allowing this writ petition.
16. The writ petition is allowed, in above terms. The rule is accordingly made absolute.
