Reason:

accused with the help of other servants took the deceased to the
hospital where the deceased died on 20.10.1994. Initially the case
was

registered

under

Section

307

IPC

which

was

subsequently

2
altered to Section 302 IPC.
4.

Upon consideration of the evidence, the Trial Court observed

that there was no intention on the part of the appellant to cause
the

death

of

deceased.

The

Trial

Court

vide

judgment

dated

16.09.1996 convicted the appellant-accused under Section 304 PartII and sentenced him to undergo ten years rigorous imprisonment.
5.

In appeal preferred by the appellant before the High Court,

the High Court after considering the facts and circumstances of the
case, reduced the sentence of imprisonment from ten years to five
years.
6.

Being

aggrieved,

the

appellant-accused

has

preferred

this

appeal.
7.

We have heard Mr. Raju Ramachandran, learned senior counsel

appearing on behalf of the appellant as well as Mr. Ravi Prakash
Mehrotra, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondentState of Madhya Pradesh.
8.

Mr. Raju Ramachandran, learned senior counsel appearing on

behalf

of

the

appellant

submitted

that

though

in

SLP

grounds

various contentions have been raised assailing the conviction but
when

we

have

heard

the

matter,

learned

senior

counsel

mainly

confined his submissions only on the question of sentence. It is
also

submitted

that

the

appellant-accused

has

two

daughters

of

marriageable age viz. 19 and 21 years and there is no male member
in the family to take care of the family and also of the daughters.
9.

Considering the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case

and also the submissions of learned senior counsel appearing

on

behalf

of

of

the

appellant-accused,

we

reduce

the

sentence

3
imprisonment awarded to the appellant from five years to two years.
10.

The appeal is partly allowed.

11.

Since the above order is passed in the peculiar facts and

circumstances

of

the

case,

the

same

may

not

be

quoted

as

precedent in any other case.
