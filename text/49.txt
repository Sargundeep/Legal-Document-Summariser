CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION
CRIMINAL APPEAL NO.1144 OF 2009

Mala Singh & Ors.

Appellants
Versus

State of Haryana

Respondent

JUDGMENT

Abhay Manohar Sapre, J.
1. This appeal is filed by the three accused persons against the final judgment and order dated
11.02.2008 passed by the High Court of Punjab & Haryana at Chandigarh in Criminal Appeal
No.65−DB of 1999 whereby the Division Bench of the High Court allowed the appeal in respect of
eight accused persons and Signature Not Verified acquitted them from the charges under Sections
148, Digitally signed by ANITA MALHOTRA Date: 2019.02.12 17:09:30 IST Reason:
302/149, 323/149 and 506/149 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (hereinafter referred to as IPC) but
dismissed the appeal in respect of the three accused persons (appellants herein) and convicted them
under Section 302/34 IPC instead of Section 302/149 IPC.
2. In order to appreciate the controversy involved in this appeal, it is necessary to set out the facts in
detail hereinbelow.
3. Eleven (11) accused persons (hereinafter referred to as A−1 to A−11) were tried for the offences
punishable under Sections 148, 302/149, 323/149 and 506/149 IPC for committing murder of one
lady − Mahendro Bai in Sessions Case No.19 of 1997.
4. Additional Sessions Judge, Faridabad, by judgment/order dated 04.12.1998, convicted all the
accused (A−1 to A−11) under Sections 148, 302/149, 323/149 and 506/149 IPC and accordingly
sentenced them to undergo life imprisonment apart from imposing other lesser sentences. The
Additional Sessions Judge held that the prosecution was able to prove the case against all the
accused persons (A−1 to A−11) beyond reasonable doubt and, therefore, all of them deserve to be

convicted accordingly.
5. All the accused persons, namely, Ranjit Singh (A−
1), Boor Singh (A−2), Puran Singh (A−3), Balwant Singh (A−4), Inder Singh (A−5), Bagga Singh
(A−6), Mala Singh (A−7), Phuman Singh(A−8), Kashmiro (A−9), Laxmi Bai(A−
10) and Taro Bai(A−11) were sentenced to suffer rigorous imprisonment for six months under
Section 148 IPC, rigorous imprisonment for life and to pay a fine of Rs.2,000/− (Rs.Two Thousand)
under Section 302/149 IPC, in default of payment of fine to further undergo rigorous imprisonment
for six months, rigorous imprisonment for three months under Section 323/149 IPC and rigorous
Imprisonment for six months under Section 506/149 IPC. All the sentences were to run
concurrently.
6. All the accused persons (A−1 to A−11) felt aggrieved by their conviction and sentence and they
filed one common criminal appeal in the High Court of Punjab & Haryana at Chandigarh (Criminal
Appeal No.65−DB of 1999).
7. By impugned order, the High Court allowed the appeal in respect of the eight accused persons,
namely, A−1 to A−6, A−10 & A−11 and acquitted them from all the charges whereas dismissed the
appeal in respect of three accused persons, namely, A−7 to A−9 and accordingly upheld their
conviction by taking recourse to Section 34 IPC. In other words, the High Court upheld the
conviction under Section 302 read with Section 34 IPC in place of 302/149 IPC.
8. The three accused persons, namely, Mala Singh(A−7), Phuman Singh(A−8) and Kashmiro(A−9),
who suffered the conviction/sentence felt aggrieved by the aforesaid order of the High Court and
they filed the present appeal by way of special leave in this Court.
9. So far as the order of the High Court, which resulted in acquittal of eight accused, namely, A−1 to
A− 6, A−10 and A−11 is concerned, the State did not challenge their acquittal order and, therefore,
this part of the order of the High Court has now attained finality.
10. We are, therefore, not required to examine the legality and correctness of this part of the
impugned order by which eight co−accused (A−1 to A−6, A−10 and A−11) were acquitted.
11. Learned counsel for the appellants, at the outset, stated that so far as appellant No.1 − Mala
Singh (A−7) is concerned, he expired during pendency of the appeal. The appeal of Mala Singh
(A−7) (appellant No.1 herein) therefore, stands abated. His appeal is accordingly dismissed as
having abated.
12. We are, therefore, now concerned with the case of two accused persons, namely, Phuman
Singh(A−8) [appellant No.2 herein] and Smt. Kashmiro(A−9) [appellant No.3 herein].

13. In other words, now we have to examine in this appeal as to whether the High Court was justified
in upholding the conviction and the sentence of appellant No.2 (A−8) and appellant No.3 (A−9).
14. In order to examine this question, it is necessary to set out the prosecution case in brief
hereinbelow.
15. The death of Mahendro Bai occurred as a result of some disputes between the members of one
family. One group consisted of one branch of brothers, their sons and the wives whereas the other
group consisted of another branch of brothers, their sons and the wives. The dispute was in relation
to the ownership and possession of an ancestral property of the family members, i.e., one
agricultural land.
16. One Mehar Singh had six brothers. They owned 22 killas of land. This land was orally partitioned
amongst all the brothers 30 years back and each brother was cultivating his share. Mehar Singh then
purchased some other land measuring 2 ½ acres in the same area. His three brothersMala Singh
(A−7), Bagga Singh (A−6) and Inder Singh (A−5) then started demanding their share in this 2 ½
acres of land from Mehar Singh which he refused saying that it was not an ancestral land and,
therefore, no need to partition. This became the cause of dispute among the brothers.
17. On 21.09.1996 at around 12 noon, Mehar Singh, Mal Singh (son of Mehar Singh), Mahendro Bai
(wife of Mal Singh−daughter in law of Mehar Singh), Dara Singh (son of Mehar Singh) and Palo
Devi (wife of Dara Singh) were sitting on the land (field) and talking to each others then, Mala Singh
(A−7), Inder Singh (A−5) , Bagga Singh (A−6) Boor Singh (A−2), Balwant Singh (A−4), Puran Singh
(A−3), Ranjit Singh (A−1), Phuman Singh (A−8), Taro Bai (A−11) and Kashmiro(A−9) came there
with weapons (lathi, country made pistol, sword, ballaum) in their hands.
18. Mala Singh (A−7) gave "Lalkara" saying that they should be taught lesson for non−partitioning
the land and be finished. This led to a fight between the two groups resulting in death of Mahendro
Bai and also causing injuries to Mehar Singh and Palo Bai.
19. This led to registration of the FIR (Ex−PN/2) by Dara Singh followed by the investigation. The
statements of several persons were recorded, evidence was collected, post−mortem report of the
deceased was obtained, weapons were seized, FSL report was obtained which led to arrest of the
aforementioned eleven persons.
20. The charge−sheet was filed against all the 11 accused persons (A−1 to A−11). The case was then
committed to the Sessions Court for trial. The prosecution examined as many as 14 witnesses. All
the accused persons (A−1 to A−11) were examined under Section 313 of the Criminal Procedure
Code, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as Cr.P.C.). They denied their involvement in the crime.
21. By judgment/order dated 04.12.1998, the Additional Sessions Judge convicted all the 11 accused
persons (A−1 to A−11) under Sections 148, 302/149, 323/149 & 506/149 IPC, as detailed above,
which gave rise to filing of the criminal appeal by all the 11 accused persons (A−1 to A−11) in the
High Court.

22. As mentioned above, the High Court acquitted eight accused persons (A−1 to A−6, A−10 & A−11)
from all the charges by giving them benefit of doubt but upheld the conviction of the present three
appellants (A−7 to A−
9) under Section 302/34 IPC instead of 302/149 IPC, which was awarded by the Additional Sessions
Judge. Against this order of the High Court, the three accused persons (A−7 to A−9) have felt
aggrieved and filed this appeal after obtaining the special leave to appeal in this Court.
23. Heard Mr. Karan Bharihoke, learned amicus curiae, Mr. Sunny Choudhary, learned counsel for
the appellants−accused persons and Mr. Atul Mangla, learned Additional Advocate General for the
respondent− State.
24. Learned counsel for the appellants (accused persons A−7 to A−9) while assailing the conviction
and sentence of the appellants submitted that the High Court erred in upholding the conviction of
the appellants. His submission was that the High Court should also have acquitted the appellants
herein along with other eight co−accused persons. Learned counsel urged that, in any case, the High
Court erred in upholding the appellants conviction and sentence under Section 302/34 IPC.
25. Learned counsel urged that it was not in dispute that the appellants along with other eight
co−accused were originally charged and eventually convicted also for an offence punishable under
Section 302 read with Section 149 IPC. With this background, when the matter was carried in appeal
at the instance of all the eleven accused persons challenging their conviction, the only question,
which fell for consideration before the High Court, was whether the conviction of all the 11 accused
persons under Section 302/149 is justified or not.
26. Learned counsel urged that the High Court was, therefore, not justified in altering the charge
from Section 302 read with Section 149 IPC to Section 302 read with Section 34 IPC suo moto and
then was not justified in upholding the conviction and that too only qua three accused persons
(appellants herein) and acquitting other eight co−accused.
27. In other words, his submission was that once the charges were framed under Section 302/149
IPC against all the 11 accused persons which resulted in their conviction under Section 302/149 IPC,
the Appellate Court had no jurisdiction to suo moto alter the charges and convict the appellants
under Section 302/34 IPC without giving them any opportunity to meet the altered charge and
simultaneously acquitting remaining eight co−accused from the charge of Section 302/149 IPC.
28. Learned counsel urged that assuming that the Appellate Court had the jurisdiction to alter the
charges qua the appellants (A−7 to A−9) only, yet, in his submission, there was no evidence adduced
by the prosecution to split the charges only against the present appellants under Section 34 IPC for
upholding their conviction under Section 302 IPC.
29. In substance, the submission was against the splitting of the charges at the appellate stage by the
High Court for convicting the appellants under Section 302/34 IPC and acquitting the remaining
eight co− accused persons under Section 302/149 IPC but not extending the similar benefit of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/86135704/

4

Mala Singh vs The State Of Haryana on 12 February, 2019

acquittal to the appellants herein.
30. The last submission of the learned counsel was that, in a case of this nature, the Appellate Court
having acquitted the eight co−accused should have examined the role of each accused (appellants
herein) in the crime. The reason being, when no case under Section 149 IPC was held made out qua
all the accused persons inasmuch as when eight co−accused stood acquitted under Section 302/149
IPC by the High Court and when there was no evidence to sustain the plea of Section 34 against the
three appellants, the only option available to the Appellate Court was to examine the role of each
appellant individually in the crime in question.
31. It was, therefore, his submission that if the role of the present two appellants is examined in the
commission of the crime then it is clear that the death of Mahendro Bai occurred on account of gun
shot injury hit by Puran Singh (A−3) who stood acquitted and Farsa injury inflicted by Mala Singh
(A−7), who has since died, and not on account of the injury caused by the present two appellants.
32. Learned counsel pointed out from the evidence that so far as appellant No.2 − Phuman Singh
(A−8) and appellant No. 3−Kashmiro (lady) (A−9) is concerned, both individually hit the deceased
with lathi which caused one simple injury on the right hand and other on left cheek of the deceased
and that too before others could inflict the fatal injuries to the deceased.
33. It was, therefore, his submission that in these circumstances, appellant Nos. 2 and 3 could at
best be convicted for an offence punishable under Section 324 IPC but not beyond it keeping in view
the law laid down by this Court on such question in Mohd. Khalil Chisti vs. State of Rajasthan & Ors.
(2013) 2 SCC 541.
34. Lastly, it was urged that since both these appellants (A−8 & A−9) have already undergone
around seven years of jail sentence and were also released on bail in the year 2009 by this Court and
both still continue to be on bail for the last 10 years, the ends of justice would be met, if both the
appellants are awarded the jail sentence of already undergone under Section 324 IPC with any fine
amount.
35. Mr. Karan Bharihoke, learned amicus curiae brought to our notice the legal position, which
apply in this case and argued ably by pointing out the evidence and how the legal principle laid
down by this Court apply to the case at hand. He also submitted his written note.
36. In reply, learned Additional Advocate General for the respondent (State) supported the
impugned order and urged that the same be upheld calling for no interference.
37. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and learned amicus curiae, we are inclined to
allow the appeal finding force in the submissions urged by the learned counsel for the appellants as
detailed below.
38. Four questions arise for consideration in this appeal−first, whether the High Court was justified
in convicting the appellants under Section 302 read with Section 34 IPC when, in fact, the initial
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/86135704/

5

Mala Singh vs The State Of Haryana on 12 February, 2019

trial was on the basis of a charge under Section 302 read with Section 149 IPC ?
39. Second, whether the High Court was justified in altering the charge under Section 149 to one
under Section 34 in relation to three accused (appellants herein) after acquitting eight co−accused
from the charges of Section 302/149 IPC and then convicting the three accused (appellants herein)
on the altered charges under Section 302/34 IPC?
40. Third, whether there is any evidence to sustain the charge under Section 34 IPC against the
three accused (appellants herein) so as to convict them for an offence under Section 302 IPC ?
41. And Fourth, in case the charge under Section 34 IPC is held not made out for want of evidence
and further when the charge under Section 149 is already held not made out by the High Court,
whether any case against three accused persons (appellants herein) is made out for their conviction
and, if so, for which offence ?
42. Before we examine the facts of the case, it is necessary to take note of the relevant sections,
which deal with alter of the charge and powers of the Court/Appellate Court in such cases.
43. Section 216 of Cr.P.C. deals with powers of the Court to alter the charge. Section 386 of Cr.P.C.
deals with powers of the Appellate Court and Section 464 of Cr.P.C. deals with the effect of omission
to frame, or absence of, or error in framing the charge. These Sections are quoted below:
216. Court may alter charge.
(1) Any Court may alter or add to any charge at any time before judgment is
pronounced.
(2) Every such alteration or addition shall be read and explained to the accused.
(3) If the alteration or addition to a charge is such that proceeding immediately with
the trial is not likely, in the opinion of the Court, to prejudice the accused in his
defence or the prosecutor in the conduct of the case, the Court may, in its discretion,
after such alteration or addition has been made, proceed with the trial as if the
altered or added charge had been the original charge.
(4) If the alteration or addition is such that proceeding immediately with the trial is likely, in the
opinion of the Court, to prejudice the accused or the prosecutor as aforesaid, the Court may either
direct a new trial or adjourn the trial for such period as may be necessary.
(5) If the offence stated in the altered or added charge is one for the prosecution of which previous
sanction is necessary, the case shall not be proceeded with until such sanction is obtained, unless
sanction had been already obtained for a prosecution on the same facts as those on which the altered
or added charge is founded.

386. Powers of the Appellate Court. After perusing such record and hearing the appellant or his
pleader, if he appears, and the Public Prosecutor if he appears, and in case of an appeal under
section 377 or section 378, the accused, if he appears, the Appellate Court may, if it considers that
there is no sufficient ground for interfering, dismiss the appeal, or may−
(a) in an appeal from an order of acquittal, reverse such order and direct that further inquiry be
made, or that the accused be re−tried or committed for trial, as the case may be, or find him guilty
and pass sentence on him according to law;
(b) in an appeal from a conviction−
(i) reverse the finding and sentence and acquit or discharge the accused, or order him to be re−tried
by a Court of competent jurisdiction subordinate to such Appellate Court or committed for trial, or
(ii) alter the finding, maintaining the sentence, or
(iii) with or without altering the finding, alter the nature or the extent, or the nature and extent, of
the sentence, but not so as to enhance the Same;
(c) in an appeal for enhancement of sentence−
(i) reverse the finding and sentence and acquit or discharge the accused or order him to be re−tried
by a Court competent to try the offence, or
(ii) alter the finding maintaining the sentence, or
(iii) with or without altering the finding, alter the nature or the extent, or the nature and extent, of
the sentence, so as to enhance or reduce the same;
(d) in an appeal from any other order, alter or reverse such order;
(e) make any amendment or any consequential or incidental order that may be just or proper;
Provided that the sentence shall not be enhanced unless the accused has had an opportunity of
showing cause against such enhancement:
Provided further that the Appellate Court shall not inflict greater punishment for the offence which
in its opinion the accused has committed, than might have been inflicted for that offence by the
Court passing the order or sentence under appeal.
464. Effect of omission to frame, or absence of, or error in, charge.
(1) No finding, sentence or order by a Court of competent jurisdiction shall be deemed invalid
merely on the ground that no charge was framed or on the ground of any error, omission or
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/86135704/

7

Mala Singh vs The State Of Haryana on 12 February, 2019

irregularity in the charge including any misjoinder of charges, unless, in the opinion of the Court of
appeal, confirmation or revision, a failure of justice has in fact been occasioned thereby. (2) If the
Court of appeal, confirmation or revision is of opinion that a failure of justice has in fact been
occasioned, it may−
(a) in the case of an omission to frame a charge, order that a charge be framed and that the trial be
recommenced from the point immediately after the framing of the charge;
(b) in the case of an error, omission or irregularity in the charge, direct a new trial to be had upon a
charge framed in whatever manner it thinks fit:
Provided that if the Court is of opinion that the facts of the case are such that no valid charge could
be preferred against the accused in respect of the facts proved, it shall quash the conviction.
44. Combined reading of Sections 216, 386 and 464 of Cr.P.C. would reveal that an alteration of
charge where no prejudice is caused to the accused or the prosecution is well within the powers and
the jurisdiction of the Court including the Appellate Court.
45. In other words, it is only when any omission to frame the charge initially or till culmination of
the proceedings or at the appellate stage results in failure of justice or causes prejudice, the same
may result in vitiating the trial in appropriate case.
46. The Constitution Bench of this Court examined this issue, for the first time, in the context of old
Criminal Procedure Code in a case reported in Willie (William) Slaney vs. State of M.P. (AIR 1956
SC 116).
47. Learned Judge Vivian Bose J. speaking for the Bench in his inimitable style of writing held,
Therefore, when there is a charge and there is either error or omission in it or both, and whatever its
nature, it is not to be regarded as material unless two conditions are fulfilled both of which are
matters of fact: (1) the accused has in fact been misled by it and (2) it has occasioned a failure of
justice. That, in our opinion, is reasonably plain language.
48. In Kantilal Chandulal Mehta vs. State of Maharashtra & Anr. (1969) 3 SCC 166, this Court again
examined this very issue arising under the present Code of Criminal Procedure with which we are
concerned in the present case. Justice P. Jaganmohan Reddy, speaking for the Bench after
examining the scheme of the Code held inter alia In our view the Criminal Procedure Code gives
ample power to the courts to alter or amend a charge whether by the trial court or by the appellate
court provided that the accused has not to face a charge for a new offence or is not prejudiced either
by keeping him in the dark about that charge or in not giving a full opportunity of meeting it and
putting forward any defence open to him, on the charge finally preferred against him.
49. Now coming to the question regarding altering of the charge from Section 149 to Section 34 IPC
read with Section 302 IPC, this question was considered by this Court for the first time in the case of
Lachhman Singh & Ors. vs. The State (AIR 1952 SC 167) where Justice Fazl Ali speaking for the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/86135704/

8

Mala Singh vs The State Of Haryana on 12 February, 2019

bench held as under:
It was also contended that there being no charge under section 302 read with section
34 of the Indian Penal Code, the conviction of the appellants under section 302 read
with section 149 could not have been altered by the High Court to one under section
302 read with section 34, upon the acquittal of the remaining accused persons. The
facts of the case are however such that the accused could have been charged
alternatively, either under section 302 read with section 149 or under section 302
read with section 34. The point has therefore no force.
50. This question was again examined by this Court in Karnail Singh & Anr. vs. State of Punjab (AIR
1954 SC 204) wherein the learned Judge Venkatarama Ayyar,J. elaborating the law on the subject
held as under:
(7) Then the next question is whether the conviction of the appellant under section
302 read with section 34, when they had been charged only, under section 302 read
with section 149, was illegal The contention of the appellants is that the scope of
section 149 is different from that of section 34, that while what section 149 requires is
proof of a common object, it would be necessary under section 34 to establish a
common intention and that therefore when the charge against the accused is under
section 149, it cannot be converted in appeal into one under section 34. The following
observations of this court in Dalip Singh v. State of Punjab, AIR 1953 SC 364 were
relied on in support of this position :− "Nor is it possible in this case to have recourse
to section 34 because the appellants have not been charged with that even in the
alternative and the common intention required by section 34 and the common object
required by section 149 are far from being the same thing."
It is true that there is substantial difference between the two sections but as observed by Lord
Sumner in Barendra Kumar Ghosh v. Emperor, AIR 1925 PC 1, they also to some extent overlap and
it is a question to be determined on the facts of each case whether the charge under section 149
overlaps the ground covered by section 34. If the common object which is the subject matter of the
charge under section 149 does not necessarily involve a common intention, then the substitution of
section 34 for section 149 might result in prejudice to the accused and ought not therefore to be
permitted. But if the facts to be proved and the evidence to be adduced with reference to the charge
under section 149 would be the same 'if the charge were under section 34, then the failure to charge
the accused under section 34 could not result in any prejudice and in such cases, the substitution of
section 34 for section 149 must be held to be a formal matter.
We do not read the observations in Dalip Singh v. State, of Punjab(1) as an authority for the broad
proposition that in law there could be no recourse to, section 34 when the charge is only under
section 149. Whether such recourse can be had or not must depend on the facts of each case. This is
in accord with the view taken by this court in Lachhman Singh v. The State (1), where the
substitution of section 34 for section 149 was upheld on the ground that the facts were such that the
accused could have been charged alternatively either under section 302 read with section 149, or
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/86135704/

9

Mala Singh vs The State Of Haryana on 12 February, 2019

under section 302read with section
34.
51. The law laid down in Lachman Singh (supra) and Karnail Singh (supra) was reiterated in Willie
(William) Slaney (Supra) wherein Justice Vivian Bose speaking for the Bench while referring to
these two decisions held as under:
(49). The following cases afford no difficulty because they directly accord with the
view we have set out at length above. In Lachman Singh v. The State, AIR 1952 SC
167, it was held that when there is a charge under section 302 of the Indian Penal
Code read with section 149 and the charge under section 149 disappears because of
the acquittal of some of the accused, a conviction under section 302 of the Indian
Penal Code read with section 34is good even though there is no separate charge
under section 302 read with section 34, provided the accused could have been so
charged on the facts of the case.
The decision in Karnail Singh v. The State of Punjab, AIR 1954 SC 204 is to the same effect and the
question about prejudice was also considered.
52. This principle of law was then reiterated after referring to law laid down in Willie (William)
Slaney (Supra) in the case reported in Chittarmal vs. State of Rajasthan (2003) 2 SCC 266 in the
following words:
14. It is well settled by a catena of decisions that section 34 as well as section 149 deal
with liability for constructive criminality i.e. vicarious liability of a person for acts of
others. Both the sections deal with combinations of persons who become punishable
as sharers in an offence. Thus they have a certain resemblance and may to some
extent overlap. But a clear distinction is made out between common intention and
common object in that common intention denotes action in concert and necessarily
postulates the existence of a pre−arranged plan implying a prior meeting of the
minds, while common object does not necessarily require proof of prior meeting of
minds or pre− concert. Though there is substantial difference between the two
sections, they also to some extent overlap and it is a question to be determined on the
facts of each case whether the charge under section 149 overlaps the ground covered
by section
34. Thus, if several persons numbering five or more, do an act and intend to do it,
both sections 34 and section 149 may apply.
If the common object does not necessarily involve a common intention, then the
substitution of section 34 for section 149 might result in prejudice to the accused and
ought not, therefore, to be permitted. But if it does involve a common intention then
the substitution of section 34 for section 149 must be held to be a formal matter.

Mala Singh vs The State Of Haryana on 12 February, 2019

Whether such recourse can be had or not must depend on the facts of each case. The
non applicability of section 149 is, therefore, no bar in convicting the appellants
under section 302 read with section 34 IPC, if the evidence discloses commission of
an offence in furtherance of the common intention of them all. (See Barendra Kumar
Ghosh Vs. King Emperor: AIR 1925 PC 1; Mannam Venkatadari and others vs. State
of Andhra Pradesh :AIR 1971 SC 1467; Nethala Pothuraju and others vs. State of
Andhra Pradesh : AIR 1991 SC 2214 and Ram Tahal and others vs. State of U.P. : AIR
1972 SC 254)
53. In the light of the aforementioned principle of law stated by this Court which is now fairly well
settled, we have to now examine the evidence of this case with a view to find out as to whether the
High Court was justified in convicting appellant Nos. 2 and 3 herein for commission of offence of
murder with the aid of Section 34 IPC which was initially not the charge framed against the
appellants herein by the Sessions Judge.
54. Having perused the entire evidence and legal position governing the issues arising in the case,
we have formed an opinion that the appeal filed by appellant Nos. 2 and 3 deserves to be allowed
and the conviction of appellant Nos. 2 and 3 deserves to be altered to Section 324 IPC. This we say
for the following reasons:
55. First, once eight co−accused were acquitted by the High Court under Section 302/149 IPC by
giving them the benefit of doubt and their acquittal attained finality, the charge under Section 149
IPC collapsed against the three appellants also because there could be no unlawful assembly
consisting of less than five accused persons. In other words, the appellants (3 in number) could not
be then charged with the aid of Section 149 IPC for want of numbers and were, therefore, rightly not
proceeded with under Section 149 IPC.
56. Second, keeping in view the law laid down by this Court in the cases referred supra, the High
Court though had the jurisdiction to alter the charge from Section 149 IPC to Section 34 IPC qua the
three appellants, yet, in our view, in the absence of any evidence of common intention qua the three
appellants so as to bring their case within the net of Section 34 IPC, their conviction under Section
302/34 IPC is not legally sustainable.
57. In other words, in our view, the prosecution failed to adduce any evidence against the three
appellants to prove their common intention to murder Mahendro Bai. Even the High Court while
altering the charge from Section 149 IPC to Section 34 IPC did not refer to any evidence nor gave
any reasons as to on what basis these three appellants could still be proceeded with under Section 34
IPC notwithstanding the acquittal of remaining eight co−accused.
58. It was the case of the prosecution since inception that all the eleven accused were part of
unlawful assembly and it is this case, the prosecution tried to prove and to some extent successfully
before the Sessions Judge which resulted in the conviction of all the eleven accused also but it did
not sustain in the High Court.

59. In our view, the evidence led by the prosecution in support of charge under Section 149 IPC was
not sufficient to prove the charge of common intention of three appellants under Section 34 IPC
though, as mentioned above, on principle of law, the High Court in its appellate jurisdiction could
alter the charge from Section 149 to Section 34 IPC.
60. Section 34 IPC does not, by itself, create any offence whereas it has been held that Section 149
IPC does. As mentioned above, the prosecution pressed their case since inception and accordingly
adduced evidence against all the accused alleging that all were the members of unlawful assembly
under Section 149 IPC and not beyond it. The Sessions Court, therefore, rightly framed a charge to
that effect.
61. If the prosecution was successful in proving this charge in the Sessions Court against all the
accused persons, the prosecution failed in so proving in the High Court.
62. The prosecution, in our view, never came with a case that all the 11 accused persons shared a
common intention under Section 34 IPC to eliminate Mahendro Bai and nor came with a case even
at the appellate stage that only 3 appellants had shared common intention independent of 8
co−accused to eliminate Mahendro Bai.
63. When prosecution did not set up such case at any stage of the proceedings against the appellants
nor adduced any evidence against the appellants that they (three) prior to date of the incident had at
any point of time shared the "common intention" and in furtherance of sharing such common
intention came on the spot to eliminate Mahendro Bai and lastly, the High Court having failed to
give any reasons in support of altered conviction except saying in one line that conviction is upheld
under Section 302/34 IPC in place of Section 302/149 IPC, the invoking of Section 34 IPC at the
appellate stage by the High Court, in our view, cannot be upheld.
64. True it is that Lalkara was given by Mala Singh − appellant No.1 (since dead) but it was not to
eliminate Mahindrao Bai − the deceased.
65. Learned counsel for the respondent(State) was not able to point out any evidence that the
appellants ever shared common intention to eliminate Mahendro Bai independent of acquitted eight
accused. We are, therefore, unable to find any basis to sustain the conviction of the appellants under
Section 302 read with Section 34 IPC for want of any evidence of the prosecution.
66. Now we come to the next issue. It has come in evidence that Mala Singh(A−7) hit with a Farsa
and Puran Singh(A−3) fired gun shot which hit Mahendro Bai. As per post−mortem report,
Mahendro Bai died due to gun shot injury. So far as the role of appellant Nos. 2 and 3 in the crime is
concerned, both hit single blow − one on hand and other on cheek of Mahendro Bai prior to other
two accused−Mala Singh and Puran Singh inflicting their assault on her.
67. As per post−mortem report, both the assault made by the appellant Nos. 2 and 3 caused simple
injury to Mahendro Bai which did not result in her death and nor could result in her death. (see
injury Nos. 2 and 3 in the evidence of PW−3 Dr. P.S. Parihar)

68. In a case of this nature, when there is a fight between the two groups and where there are gun
shots exchanged between the two groups against each other and when on evidence eight co−accused
are completely let of and where the State does not pursue their plea of Section 149 IPC against the
acquitted eight accused which attains finality and where the plea of Section 34 IPC is not framed
against any accused and where even at the appellate stage no evidence is relied on by the
prosecution to sustain the charge of Section 34 IPC qua the three accused appellants independent of
eight acquitted co−accused and when out of two main accused assailants, one has died and the other
is acquitted and lastly, in the absence of any reasoning given by the High Court for sustaining the
conviction of the three appellants in support of alteration of the charge, we are of the considered
view that the two appellants are entitled to claim the benefit of entire scenario and seek alteration of
their conviction for commission of the offence punishable under Section 324 IPC simplicitor rather
than to suffer conviction under Section 302/34 IPC, if not complete acquittal alike other eight co−
accused.
69. We are, therefore, of the considered opinion that appellant Nos. 2 and 3 could at best be
convicted for an offence punishable under Section 324 IPC and not beyond it on the basis of their
individual participation in the commission of the crime.
70. Learned counsel for the appellants then stated that out of the total jail sentence awarded,
appellant Nos. 2 and 3 has already undergone around seven years of jail sentence when both were
released on bail by orders of this Court on 07.07.2009. So far as the appellant No. 3 is concerned,
she is an aged lady.
71. Taking into consideration the fact that the appellants Nos. 2 and 3 have already undergone seven
years of jail sentence and appellant No. 3 is an aged lady and is also on bail for the last 10 years and
that both did not breach any condition of the bail in last the 10 years, we are inclined to allow the
appeal and while setting aside the conviction and sentence of the appellant Nos. 2 and 3 under
Section 302/34 IPC, convert their conviction under Section 324 IPC and sentence them to what they
have already undergone and impose a fine of Rs.10,000/− on each appellant and in default in
payment of fine, to further undergo three months simple imprisonment.
72. In other words, the appellants (Nos.2 & 3) need not undergo any jail sentence than what they
have already undergone provided each of the appellants deposit Rs.10,000/− as fine amount within
three months from the date of this order else both the appellants will have to undergo three months
simple imprisonment in default of non−deposit of fine amount.
73. Before parting, we place on record a word of appreciation for the valuable services rendered by
Mr. Karan Bharihoke amicus curiae appointed by this Court. He argued the case ably and fairly and
also filed effective written submissions, which enabled us to examine the issue involved in this
appeal properly.
74. The appeal thus succeeds and is allowed in part. The impugned order is modified to the extent
indicated above.
