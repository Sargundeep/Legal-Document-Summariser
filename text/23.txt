Ms. S.A. Mudbidri for the Respondent.
----CORAM : A.S.GADKARI, J.

DATE : 17th June 2019.
ORAL JUDGMENT:1] By the present petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India, the petitioner hss taken
exception to the concurrent findings recorded by the Revenue Authorities below.
2] Heard the learned counsel for the respective parties. Perused the record.
3] The petitioner had filed an application under Section 70(b) of the Bombay Tenancy And
Agricultural Lands Act, 1948 (for short B.T.A.L. Act) claiming to be tenant in old Survey Nos.111
(New Sr.No.61) Hissa 208-WP.3843-1996.doc No.2 admeasuring 88 ares and 114 (New Sr. No.37)
Hissa No.2 admeasuring 4 ares lying and situate at village Sangirde, Taluka Kudal, District
Sindudurg. It was the contention of the respondents that, the husband of the petitioner was a tenant
in the disputed lands and in the year 1952 the deceased brother of the respondent No.3 took
possession of the lands in dispute from him according to law.
The record indicates that, the original tenant was allowed to occupy the house/manger in the land
bearing Survey No.111 Hissa No.2 as a tenant under the Transfer of Property Act.
4] The Agricultural Lands Tribunal (for short "ALT") after recording evidence and scrutinizing the
material available on record, was pleased to hold that the petitioner has failed to prove her tenancy
in the disputed land and dismissed her application. The appeal preferred by the petitioner bearing
FSO/TNC Appeal No.99 of 1989 before the Forest Settlement Officer, Sawantwadi under Section 74

of B.T.A.L. Act has been dismissed with cost by the said Authority by its Judgment and Order dated
20.10.1994.
The Revision Application preferred by the petitioner under section 76 of B.T.A.L. Act bearing
No.Ten/A. 112 of 1995 has been partly 208-WP.3843-1996.doc allowed by the Maharashtra Revenue
Tribunal. The Revenue Tribunal has held that, the petitioner has proved her tenancy in respect of
old survey No.111/2. As far as her claim regarding tenancy in respect old Survey No.114/2 is
concerned, the same is rejected and the order passed by the Additional Tahsildar, Kudal in that
behalf is confirmed. 5] The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that, the basis on which the
Revenue Tribunal has held the petitioner to be eligible to be a tenant in respect of survey no.111/2, is
the same for claiming her tenancy for survey No.114/2 also and therefore the Tribunal has erred in
appreciating the evidence in its proper perspective. He submitted that, the respondents/landlord
have failed to dispel the contention of the petitioner about her tenancy and therefore there is
presumption under the law that, the petitioner is also a tenant in respect of survey No.114/2 which is
the disputed land in question. He submitted that, all the Authorities below did not take into
consideration the evidence on record in its proper perspective while rejecting the claim of the
petitioner pertaining to survey No.114/2. He submitted that, the Orders passed by the Authorities
below need to be quashed and set aside and the petitioner be declared as tenant in survey no.114/2
also by allowing the present petition.
208-WP.3843-1996.doc 6] The Supreme Court in the case of Maruti Bala Raut Vs. Dashrath Babu
Wathare & Ors. reported in AIR 1974 SC 2051, has held that, the Tribunal while exercising its
powers under Section 76 of B.T.A.L. Act, the said Act, has no power to deal with the matter as an
Appellate Authority and was not therefore entitled to appreciate the evidence and come to its own
conclusion. It is further held that, the High Court while exercising its powers under Article 227 of
the Constitution of India was not entitled to discuss the evidence and come to its own conclusion on
the evidence as to who was in possession of the land. That was a matter for Revenue Authorities.
7] The Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in the case of Syed Yakoob Vs. K.S. Radhakrishnan
& Others, reported in AIR 1964 SC 477 while dealing with the scope of jurisdiction of the High
Court, in issuing writ of certiorari has held that, it is a supervisory jurisdiction and the Court
exercising it is not entitled to act as an appellate Court. This limitation necessarily means that
findings of fact reached by the inferior Court or Tribunal as a result of the appreciation of evidence
cannot be reopened or questioned in writ proceedings. An error of law which is apparent on the face
of record can be corrected by a writ, but not an error 208-WP.3843-1996.doc of fact, however, grave
it may appear to be. It is further held that, a finding of fact recorded by the Tribunal cannot,
however, be challenged in proceedings for a writ of certiorari on the ground that the relevant and
material evidence adduced before the Tribunal was insufficient or inadequate to sustain the
impugned finding. The adequacy or sufficiency of evidence led on a point and the inference of fact to
be drawn from the said finding being within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tribunal, the points
cannot be agitated before a writ Court.
8] The Supreme Court in the case of Shalini Shyam Shetty & Anr. Vs. Rajendra Shankar Patil,
reported in (2010) 8 SCC 329 has enumerated the principles in the exercise of High Court's

jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. It is held that, the High Courts cannot, at
the drop of a hat, in exercise of its power under Article 227 of the Constitution, interfere with the
Orders of tribunals or courts interior to it. Nor can it, in exercise of this power, act as a court of
appeal over the orders of the court or tribunal subordinate to it. In cases, where an alternative
statutory mode of redressal has been provided, that would also operate as a restrain on the exercise
of this power by the High Court. That, the High Court can interfere in exercise of its power of
superintendence when there has been a 208-WP.3843-1996.doc patent perversity in the orders of
the tribunals and courts subordinate to it or where there has been a gross and manifest failure of
justice or the basic principles of natural justice have been flouted.
It is further held that, in exercise of its power of superintendence, the High Court cannot interfere to
correct mere errors of law or fact or just because another view than the one taken by the tribunals or
courts subordinate to it, is a possible view. In other words, the jurisdiction has to be very sparingly
exercised. That, the power of interference under this Article is to be kept to the minimum to ensure
that the wheel of justice does not come to a halt and the fountain of justice remains pure and
unpolluted in order to maintain public confidence in the functioning of the tribunals and courts
subordinate to the High Court.
The afore-stated view expressed in the case of Shalini S. Shetty (Supra) has been further affirmed by
the larger Bench of the Supreme Court in the case of Radhey Shyam & Anr. Vs. Chhabi Nath and
Ors. Reported in (2015) 5 SCC 423.
9] In the Order dated 31st July 1989 passed in Tenancy Case No.7 of 1986, the Additional
Tahasildar, Kudal has observed that, the original tenant was allowed to occupy the house and the
manger in the land bearing 208-WP.3843-1996.doc in Survey No.111 Hissa No.2 as a tenant under
the Transfer of Properties Act even after his surrender of tenancy right in favour of the respondent
No.3. The said fact on record is undisputed fact which has been weighed in the mind of the Revenue
Tribunal while partly allowing the Revision Application of the petitioner. As noted earlier, the
Tribunal has held that, the petitioner has proved her tenancy in respect of old survey No.111/2. The
finding recorded by the Revenue Tribunal need not be disturbed and/or reappreciated in writ
jurisdiction under Article 227 of Constitution of India. The record clearly indicates that, the Revenue
Tribunal after scrutinizing the entire evidence available on record has arrived at the said conclusion.
10] After perusing the entire record made available before me, I am of the considered view that, the
Revenue Tribunal has not committed any error either in law or on facts while passing the impugned
Judgment and Order dated 8th April 1996.
The present petition is accordingly dismissed.
(A.S.GADKARI, J.)
