DATE : 29.05.2019.

fine of Rs. 1,500/- or in default to suffer simple imprisonment for four months. Both the sentences
are to run concurrently.
3. This Court has admitted the appeal on 24.11.2005, and allowed Criminal Application No.
3233/2005, thereby directing release of applicant/ appellant on bail.
4. The raid/trap in the matter was conducted on 11.10.1996 and at that time appellant was about 41
years old, thus, now he is more than 63 years of his age.
5. In this backdrop, Advocate Choube submitted that sanction for prosecution accorded by PW-3
Shubhendu vide Exh. 33 is vitiated. He contends that according sanction under Section 19(a) is not
an empty formality and the authority concerned must apply its mind to all relevant parts. PW-3 has
merely signed the proposed draft for grant of sanction sent by Anti Corruption Bureau (ACB) and
this act shows total non-application of mind. He relies upon cross-examination of this witness to
demonstrate that material papers having bearing on the process of application of mind, were never
called for and hence the grant of sanction itself its vitiated and void. Prosecution commenced on its
basis and conviction, therefore, cannot be sustained. He relies upon judgment of this Court in the
matter of Nishikant Bhaskarrao Kulkarni since deceased) through his Legal Heirs (Dr.) & Ors. Vs.
State of Maharashtra, reported at (2019)2 Bombay Case Reporter (Criminal) Page No. 18.
Judgment 3 Cri.apeal609.2015.odt
6. Without prejudice and in the alternative, learned counsel contends that evidence of PW-1,
Complaint & PW-2 Shadow witness and the two officers of the Anti Corruption Bureau is mutually
inconsistent and therefore cast a cloud of doubt on entire prosecution version, he states that charge
was framed by the Trial Court vide Exhibit No. 4 on 24.08.2004 and it was denied by appellant who
has claimed false implication. Burden was therefore on prosecution to show not only the demand
and its acceptance but also to prove the trap by cogent and convincing evidence.
7. He states that complainant PW-1 Keshav s/o Amrut had sought advance from his Provident Fund
amount for performing marriage of his daughter. The amount is payable as advance and therefore
before marriage. Admittedly as per this witness, marriage of his daughter was already performed on
scheduled date in May 1996 only. However, thereafter, he incorrectly and falsely represented that
the marriage of his daughter was postponed initially to 27th August, 1996, and thereafter pointed
out that it was postponed to 10th October, 1996. This inconsistent and false conduct on part of
complaint, itself is sufficient to infer an attempt to victimize the officers of Coal Mines Provident
Fund Establishment (hereinafter be referred to as 'CMPF' for the sake of brevity). By relying upon
Exhibit No. 12, he submits that the said documents dated 11.10.1996 filed as complaint to Central
Bureau of Investigation fact of moving application on 2 nd May, 1996, has been pointed out and he
has disclosed that Assistant Clerk in the CMPF Office demanded Rs. 2,000/- from him as bribe for
sanctioning loan of Rs. 40,000/-. He submits that the details of accused demanding the amount are
not appearing therein.

8. He invites attention to evidence of complaint, PW-2 Shadow witness Shri Devrao Moudekar and
PW-7 Rajesh Vishnoi to urge that from then evidence and its comparison with evidence of PW-5
Shri Kanhaiya Sinha fabrication of documents is apparent. Learned counsel states that date and
time of receipt of report lodged by complainant, the time at which work of drawing Exh. 23,
Panchanama (Part-1) began and its conclusion all show that the authorities colluded together to
prepare false documents.
9. According to him, this gets substantiated from time mentioned in Panchanama (Part-2) at Exh.
24 and so called recovery memo of currency note of Exh. 25.
10. Learned counsel states that story of prosecution that complaint and shadow witness first met
accused in his office and then he took them to his residence which is located in same campus, is not
substantiated at all by producing entry from visitors book or by pointing out any movement register.
He submits that PW-4 Biradar Sinha examined by prosecution shows that at 11:00 am accused was
not in his seat and when he returned, again he did not see anybody in the office. This witness heard
loud noise and people saying that appellant was traped by ACB, he heard this noise at about 11:15
a.m. This according to him falsifies the entire prosecution story.
11. Learned counsel states that evidence of PW-1, complaint about meeting accused persons on
two-three occasions prior to 11.10.1996 is shaky. If he had visited flat (residence) of accused, he
could not describe it properly and he also could not explain arrangement inside the flat. Complaint
could not explain how from inside or outside, he gave pre-decided Judgment 5
Cri.apeal609.2015.odt signal or removing the spectacles to the others. According to prosecution
PW- 2 Maudekar was standing outside the flat and as such, he could not have heard anything.
Despite this, PW-2 narrates the talk between accused and PW-1, which took allegedly inside the flat.
Evidence on record creates doubt about giving of signal. It is not clear whether signal was given to
Maudekar or then to remaining raiding party with whom ACB Officers and 2 nd Panchanama
witness (Part-2) were standing.
12. Inviting the attention to deposition of PW-1, he shows a statement that the amount of Rs. 300/recovered allegedly from shirt pocket of accused was kept in one envelope. However, when
prosecutor opened that envelope, amount of Rs. 800/- was taken out. He further submits that
during examination of PW-5 Kanhaiya Sinha, it is again recorded that this envelope was opened and
8 notes were found in it. Learned counsel submits that when envelope was already opened and 8
notes were taken out, there is no question of its being reopened during evidence of Investigating
Officer Shri Kanhaiya Sinha.
13. Learned counsel states that amount of Rs. 800/- is stated to be agreed amount of bribe and as
per prosecution in trap, Rs. 300/- were recovered from shirt pocket while remaining amount of Rs.
500/- were taken out of an Almirah in the flat of accused. This bifurcation gets lost because all 8
notes were taken out from envelope article P-3. This runs counter to story of complainant.
14. He further states that role of accused in the process of sanctioning of marriage advance has not
been brought on record at all.

Judgment 6 Cri.apeal609.2015.odt Evidence of PW-6 Ashok Pohankar shows that he was dealing
with marriage advance cases and charge was not given to accused at all.
15. In the light of this evidence on record, learned counsel states that work of recording of
Panchanama (Part-2) (Exh. 24) which begins at 12:30 continued up to 15:00 hours and this
Panchanama does not mention that raiding party moved from residence to office. Recovery memo
Exh. 25 shows recovery of 8 notes and its recording commenced at 12:30 hours. Learned counsel
submits that this recovery memo therefore is part of Panchanama (Part-2) and Panchanama
(Part-2) is over in the office of Coal Mines Provident Fund, recovery memo at Exh. 25, therefore, is
also recorded in CMPF only and not at the residence of accused. He has drawn attention to
cross-examination of PW-4 Birader Sinha to show that documents were seized from table of accused
by CBI at about 12:30 hours and at that time CBI Inspector, witness PW-4 and Regional
Commissioner Shri Verma were present. Other Officers were also present but no outsiders was
present. Thus, PW-2 who was working as Assistant Manager in Indian Overseas Bank or Shri
Pendhari were therefore not present when second Panchanama was recorded. Learned counsel
states that despite this, the signature of both Panch witnesses namely PW-2 Devrao Maudekar, and
one Shri G.J. Pendhari appear on Panchanama (Part-2) as also on recovery memo Exh. 25. He
therefore claims that documents at Exh. 24 & 25 needs to be discarded as they do not inspire
confidence at all.
16. The attention of Court is invited to fact that no inventory of documents allegedly seized from
table of accused has been prepared by the Judgment 7 Cri.apeal609.2015.odt Investigating Officer
and no such list is proved before Trial Court. Learned counsel states that in this situation entire
exercise undertaken to show that a trap was laid and has succeeded must be disbelieved.
17. He contends that as per version of prosecution the initial demand of bribe was of Rs. 2,000/and it was brought down to Rs. 800/- during negotiations. However, this fact is also not proved on
record.
18. Learned counsel places reliance upon the judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court reported in (2015)10
SCC 152 in the matter of P. Satyanarayana Murthy Vs. District Inspector of Police, State of Andhra
Pradesh and anr. to urge that unless and until the demand as such he established, there cannot be
any conviction either under Section 7 or under Section 13 of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.
According to him, mere acceptance of any amount allegedly by way of illegal gratification or
recovery thereof without proving demand is not sufficient to sustain the conviction. He contends
that the appellant/accused has denied the entire episode and as such, the conviction needs to be
quashed and set aside.
19. Advocate Mrs. Chandurkar, the learned counsel for respondent/state that after receipt of report
at Exh. 12 on 11.10.1996, at about 9:45 a.m., the steps to register FIR and preparatory steps for
arranging a trap were undertaken simultaneously. The complaint tendered by PW-1, was registered
and the steps in investigation were taken by PW-5 Kanhaiya Sinha immediately. She submits that
mention of time as such, in Panchanama (Part-1), or other documents including Exh. 12 is not
decisive, PW-2 Devrao Maudekar was called in CBI Office at 10:00 a.m. and this Judgment 8

4

Ravindra Marotrao Thakre vs The Government Of India ... on 29 May, 2019

Cri.apeal609.2015.odt assertion by him on oath, cannot be lost sight of.
20. She further submits that documents seized on record are duly exhibited as Exh. 17 to 20 and
Exh. 44 to 49. There is no challenge to these documents. The contention that marriage had taken
place in May 1996 itself has got no bearing on the controversy. Whether advance claimed was legal
or otherwise cannot be examined in this jurisdiction. The amount was prayed for by moving
application on 2 nd May, 1996, is not in dispute and the fact that amount was not paid till the date of
raid is also not in dispute. The complaint has in the meanwhile moved applications pointing out
postponement of date of marriage initially to 27.08.1996 and thereafter to 10.10.1996. This
postponement again is therefore not relevant. She relies upon evidence of PW-7 Rajesh Visnoi to
show that this witness has contacted office of CMPF in the month of November and December 1996
and then seized certain note-sheets vide Exh. 35. She further points out that Exh. 47 - claim register
and Exh. 48 - Pay Order register clearly show that appellant/accused was associated with loan case
of complainant. He cannot therefore take advantage of the fact that seizure memo has not been
exhibited. She points out that fact of seizure is brought on record sufficiently in evidence of PW-4Birader Sinha. However, on technical ground that Birader Sinha has not signed the document Trial
Court held that he could not have proved the contents of seizure memo. She submits that contents
that seizure memo became irrelevant movement the above registers and note- sheets are exhibited
during the course of evidence. According to her, note- sheets show delaying tactics and the
documents demonstrate that though pay order/cheque was ready, it was not made over to complaint
deliberately & he Judgment 9 Cri.apeal609.2015.odt got that cheque two to three days after the trap.
21. According to her, the defence of total denial in such circumstances is of no assistance to accused.
The seizure of his shirt is not disputed by him specifically. Not only this fact that amount of Rs.
300/- was taken out from his shirt pocket, is not in dispute. Those notes had phenolphthalein
powder and turning of solution colour to purple when hands were tested for phenolphthalein
powder, is not in dispute. She contends that hand-wash and shirt wash of shirt of accused clinch the
controversy and burden shifted to accused to explain how tainted money came into his shirt pocket.
22. The learned counsel states that neither Investigating Officer nor Panch had any adverse interest
against the appellant, and therefore, absence of relevant entries in visit book or then mention of
proper details in Panchanama, cannot enure to the benefit of accused. She relies upon the judgment
of Hon'ble Apex court reported in (2007) 7 SCC 625 Girja Prasad(Dead) By LRS. Vs. State of M.P.
23. During their arguments both the learned Advocates have invited my attention to various parts of
depositions and also to certain precedents. I find it convenient to referred to the same as and when
occasions therefor arises in the course of this judgment.
24. It will be appropriate to first consider the technical objection that consent at Exh. 33 is vitiated.
Judgment of this Court in case of Nishikant Bhaskarrao Kulkani Vs. State of Maharashtra (cited
supra) looks Judgment 10 Cri.apeal609.2015.odt into this aspect in paragraph 12. In that paragraph,
judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court reported in (1997) 7 SCC 622 Mansukhlal Vitthaldas Chavhan Vs.
State of Gujrat has been relied upon. This judgment shows that sanction cannot be granted without
proper application of mind and public interest as also protection available to public servant need to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/42893155/

5

Ravindra Marotrao Thakre vs The Government Of India ... on 29 May, 2019

be kept in mind. The frivolous and vexatious prosecution needs to be avoided. Validity of sanction
therefore depends upon the material placed before sanctioning authority and consideration of all
material facts and evidence by the sanctioning authority. The order of sanction ex facie must
disclosed that sanctioning authority had considered such material. This consideration can be
established in Court by producing relevant files demonstrating its consideration by sanctioning
authority. In facts before it, this Court has observed that Municipal Council had exercised advisory
jurisdiction by passing a resolution that accused No. 1 deserved to be prosecuted. Sanctioning
authority there had upheld said resolution and granted the sanction. This Court found that material
on record was in-sufficient to show proper application of mind and the authority treated grant of
sanction as an idle formality. Learned Single Judge found that it merely acted upon resolution
passed by Municipal Council.
25. In matter before me, the authority according sanction has entered witness box as PW-3. The
sanction order at Exh. 33 dated 24.04.1997 contains narration of previous history as disclosed in his
complaint at Exh. 12 by complainant, fact of trap, successful completion thereof, drawing of
Panchanama (Part-1), accused and complainant leaving office complex and going to residential
quarters, the raiding party catching accused red handed, the effect of hand-wash test and seizure of
currency Judgment 11 Cri.apeal609.2015.odt notes as also shirt of accused. It also notices
commission of an offence under Section 7 and Section 13 (1) (d) of Prevention of Corruption Act,
1988. The authority granting sanction then explains its status vis-a-vis the post held by accused and
then accords sanction under Section 19(a) of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.
26. This authority in examination-in-chief has pointed out that it received papers, went through it,
applied mind and came to the conclusion prima facie that bribe was accepted. This authority proved
sanction letter at Exh. 33.
27. The cross-examination of this witnesses shows absence of reference in sanction order to papers
received from its office in December 1996, absence of specific mention that complaint of
complainant was perused. Authority also accepts that designation of authority was typed with
carbon. This witness also accepts that he did not verify allegation against accused from CMPF Office
and did not call from comments from said office. He did not annex any documents with sanction
letter. The fact that draft sanction order was sent by CBI is also not mentioned in sanction order.
28. This cross-examination does not in any way militate with the facts mentioned in Paragraph 14
about acceptance of bribe and recovery of tainted money from the accused. In paragraph 19 full and
careful examination of material in regard to allegations against accused and of circumstances of the
case is also mentioned. The cross-examination therefore, does not show that the process of
application of mind for grant of sanction under Section 19 is not proper or there is any jurisdictional
error or Judgment 12 Cri.apeal609.2015.odt perversity. Authority granting sanction is not required
to consider the probable defence at all. The necessary documents showing involvement or
connection of accused with the loan case of complainant were already produced by PW-3 Shri Das.
The error noticed by this Court in its reported judgment (cited supra) does not exist in this matter.
Therefore, exercise of according sanction vide Exh. 33 in present matter is not vitiated.

Ravindra Marotrao Thakre vs The Government Of India ... on 29 May, 2019

29. Coming to the merits of controversy, the defence of present appellant is that of total denial.
Answers given by him during the Section 313 Cr.P.C. examination or then suggestion given to
witnesses during examination, do not bring on record, any specific defence. Though in answer to last
question in Section 313 examination, the accused has stated that he is falsely implicated, he has not
chosen to enter witness box and has not examined any witness in defence.
30. During arguments before me, effort has been made to show that Panchanama (Part-2) was not
written at one place and it is prepared by way of after thought. Submission is the process of drawing
that Panchanama has to begin after 2nd Panch and raiding party entered the premises and accused
person is apprehended, red handed. Here time factor mentioned in Exh. 24 & 25 derogates from
transparency and vitiates the entire exercise.
31. Exh. 25 is the recovery memo of 8 currency notes and it is recorded on 11.10.1996. It mentions
date and time of recovery to be 12:30 hours and place of recovery is shown as the left side upper
shirt pocket of accused and the Almirah located in bed-room in quarter No. B-3 at CMPF Complex.
This Panchanama is duly proved by the prosecution and crossJudgment 13 Cri.apeal609.2015.odt examination does not bring on record the fact that it has been
falsely prepared.
32. This Panchanama Exh. 25 does find mention in Panchanama (Part-2) Exh. 24. This Exh. 24 is
signed by very same Panch witnesses Shri Maudekar, Shri Pendhari. It mentions that recording of
this Panchanama Exh. 24 began at 12:30 hours and it was over at 15:00 hours. It is obvious that
after receipt of signal when the raiding party visited the flat, first thing to be done was to recover
tainted amount and this fact is also mentioned in Exh. 24. This exhibit also mentions that balance
amount of Rs. 500/- was in the Almirah in said flat, it also records seizure of said amount under a
separate recovery memo which obviously is Exh. 25. Then it points out process of obtaining
hand-wash and personal search of accused as also personnel search of complainant. It mentions
conversation which was heard by shadow witness Shri Maudekar and exact conversation is also
reproduced. After this process is over Panchanama (Part-2) mentions search of table drawer of
accused in his office, seizure of documents relating to Provident Fund advance of Keshavrao and a
fact that a seizure memo was drawn. This Panchanama (Part-2) therefore, points out steps-wise and
stage-wise action by CBI Officers.
33. Fact that seizure of documents was effected from table of accused is also deposed to by Sectional
Supervisor Shri Birader Sinha (PW4), Trial Court did not exhibit seizure memo because it did not contain his signature. This witness
has deposed that no outsiders was present at that time of seizure of documents from table and a
specific suggestion given to Judgment 14 Cri.apeal609.2015.odt him that no documents was seized
from table of accused in his presence, is denied by him.
34. The seizure memo therefore has not been exhibited and accused has not relied upon that seizure
memo. Accused only relies upon mention of that seizure in Panchanama (Part-2). This Panchanama
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/42893155/

7

Ravindra Marotrao Thakre vs The Government Of India ... on 29 May, 2019

(Part-2) is signed by Shri Maudekar and Shri Pendhari. Witness Shri Sinha has stated that no
outsider was present during that seizure. Accused has not given any specific suggestion to bring on
record, the fact that Shri Maudekar and Shri Pendhari were also not present in the office at that
time.
35. This technical aspect however, need not detain us. The fact that initial loan application was
moved sometime in May 1996 is not in dispute, fact that loan was ultimately received by complaint
two or three days after actual raid is also not in dispute. Fact that marriage was already over in May
1996 is brought on record by accused in cross-examination of complaint. The documents like Exh.
15 or Exh. 21, which mention the proposed date of marriage to be 10.10.1996 or 27.08.1996 are also
not in dispute. Thus, accused accepts the position that though marriage was over in May 1996,
complaint in his applications submitted to CMPF Office vide Exh. 21 declared 27.08.1996 to the date
of marriage and by later application at Exh. 15, declared 10.10.1996 to be that date.
36. The two registers in the office of CMPF i.e. Claim Register for October 1996 and Pay Order
Register for that month are not in dispute. Relevant entry in claim register dated 01.10.1996 is at
Exh. 47 and in pay order register, entry dated 03.10.1996 is at Exh. 48. Witness Shri Ashok
Judgment 15 Cri.apeal609.2015.odt Pohankar (PW-6) has deposed that entries for October 1996 in
pay order register are written by accused. The relevant entry has been marked at Exh.
48. This witness has also deposed in Column No. 11 at Exh. 48, there is signature of accused. There
is no challenge in cross-examination to this averment. Only suggestion given to this witness is that
entry at Exh. 48 is not in handwriting of the accused. However, there is no suggestion given about
signature of accused appearing in Column No. 11 in that entry. PW-6 also points out pendency of
loan application moved by complainant, its rejection and subsequent developments. It is not
necessary to delve more into this aspect. The technical objection that seizure memo has not been
exhibited or proved, does not therefore, advance defence of appellant at all. The signature of
appellant/accused in Column No. 11 against Exh. 48 shows his association with the process. At
Column No. 11, hearding is about initials of dealing clerk. This entry, therefore, brings on record the
fact that appellant/accused was the dealing clerk. His signature in Column No. 11 is made on
09.10.1996. As per later at Exh. 50 marriage of daughter of complainant was disclosed to be
scheduled on next day i.e. 10.10.1996 and raid has been conducted on 11.10.1996.
37. This necessitates, reference to first document i.e. complaint made by complainant Keshav to CBI
vide Exh. 12. This complaint is dated 11.10.1996. Therein he has mentioned previous history and
then, he has also mentioned that on number of occasions, he contacted Shri Ravindra Thakre the
Assistant Clerk in CMPF Office. He has also stated that Shri Thakre demanded bribe of Rs. 2,000/and ultimately Shri Thakre declared that he would not accept anything less than Rs. 800/-. He has
also declared that he Judgment 16 Cri.apeal609.2015.odt was called in CMPF Office at 11:00 a.m.
with bribe amount. This complaint is signed by complainant and also by two witnesses. The steps to
arrange for trap were initiated thereafter. FIR at Exh. 40 mentions of date and time of report as 9:40
a.m. Thus it only shows that this intimation was received by the Special Police Establishment at
Nagpur at 9:40 a.m. in the morning. PW- 5 Kanhaiya Sinha Inspector with CBI has stated that after
receiving a complaint, he registered crime and called Panch witnesses.

Ravindra Marotrao Thakre vs The Government Of India ... on 29 May, 2019

38. Fact that the accused had called complainant at 11:00 a.m. in the office, already appears in Exh.
12. In this situation, if steps to draw prepartory Panchanama (Part-1) were initiated simultaneously
to save the time, no fault can be found it. Shri Kanhaiya Sinha has recorded that this Panchanama
(Part-1) commenced at 10:00 a.m. and was concluded at 11:00 a.m.
39. During arguments, counsel for appellant in order to point out the inconsistent mention of time,
has relied upon the written notes of arguments which were filed before Trial Court at Exh. 58.
Attention was drawn to at Para 'e'. It is to be noted that the Panchanama (Part-2) shows that at 11:55
hours, accused and complainant were seen coming out of office complex and proceeding to
residential quarters. Other details in this respect are already stated above by me.
40. Only inconsistent version brought on record is by PW-4 Birader Sinha, who at the time of the
deposition, had already retired. In 1995-96, he was working at Sectional Superintendent in CMPF
Office. Four to five employees i.e. accused, one Bawankar & two-three ladies were working in
Judgment 17 Cri.apeal609.2015.odt the office. He claims that he attended office at about 10:30 a.m.
and at about 11:00 a.m. two or three persons entered their office, one person came to his Section
and disclosed that they were searching for some body. In the meanwhile Birader Sinha was called
for by Regional Commissioner and therefore, he went to that officer. When he returned back, he did
not see anybody. At 11:15 a.m. he heard a loud voice in his office and people were crying that accused
Rajendra Thakre was caught.
41. This witness, therefore, points out that enquiry about some person were meet him at 11:00 a.m.
and than he left the office to attend to Regional Commissioner, he came back within 15 minutes and
learnt about the raid. At that time, there was nobody in the office.
42. This person, therefore, does not state that raid was conducted in the office. Who were the people
making inquiry or shouting in loud voice is not clear. Accused has not cross-examined PW-4 in this
respect. His deposition and time factor therefore is irrelevant and does not bring on record any
material inconsistency.
43. Depositions of complainant (PW-1) Keshav (PW-2) Maudekar and PW-5 Kanhaiya Sinha bring
on record, the relevant facts. The business of complainant Keshav in the CMPF Office is not in
dispute, fact that he was disparately after the loan amount can be seen from his applications
mentioned supra. Fact that he got actual disbursement after raid is also brought on record. He has
pointed out the demand and PW-2 Maudekar shadow witness has also supported him. The actual
conversation containing it forms part of Panchanama (Part-2).
Judgment 18 Cri.apeal609.2015.odt
44. The acceptance of amount of Rs. 800/- by accused is proved by establishing identity of 8 notes
of Rs. 100/- denomination each. Three notes are seized from shirt pocket on person of accused and
5 notes were seized from Almirah in his bed-room as indicated by him. The defence of accused is of
total denial, however, he has not pointed out why he would be falsely implicated, he has also not
pointed out why the Police Inspector PW-5 would proceed to falsely implicate him. There is

absolutely no reason for shadow witness Shri Devrao Maudekar (PW-2) to depose falsely against
accused.
45. The perusal of provisions of Section 20 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, shows that it
prescribes a presumption where public servant accepts any undue advantage. It stipulates that
where in any trial for offence punishable under Section 7, it is proved that the public servant accused
of such offence has accepted the amount from any person, unless the contrary is proved, it shall be
presumed that it was accepted as a motive or reward under Section 7 for performing the public duty.
Though in present facts, the accused has taken up plea of false implication and total denial, he has
not come up with a case that shirt seized and produced before Trial Court did not belong to him. He
has not explained how tainted notes reached pocket of that shirt or than Almirah in his bed-room.
In the light of Section 20, his defence of total denial, therefore, is unsustainable.
46. Reliance by accused on judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court in the matter of P. Satyanarayana
Murthy Vs. District Inspector of Police, State of Andhra Pradesh and anr. reported in (2015) 10 SCC
152 to urge that demand and acceptance must be proved by cogent evidence and mere Judgment 19
Cri.apeal609.2015.odt acceptence of amount cannot be seen as illegal gratification in present facts is
misconceived.
47. The judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court in the matter of Baldev Singh Vs. State of Harayana,
reported in (2015)17 SCC 554 is cited by respondent to submit that deposition of witnesses recorded
in official capacity cannot be labelled as unworthy as he is interested evidence. This judgment,
however, considers credibility of evidence of a police officer. It is observed that merely because of
his position as police officer, his evidence cannot be discarded , Hon'ble Apex Court, however, has
clarified that prudence required careful scrutiny & independent appreciation of such evidence.
48. Reliance by accused on the judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court in the matter of Vinod Kumar Vs.
State of Punjab, reported in (2015)3 SCC 220 is more apt. In paragraph No. 21 to 24 Hon'ble Court
looked into the evidence of trap witnesses and in paragraph 24 concluded that trap witness is
interested witness and his testimony needs to be accepted and relied upon after due corroboration.
Few more judgment are cited by parties for this purpose however, in present matter, I do not find it
necessary to dwell on it.
49. Judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court in the matter of Girja Prasad (Dead) By LRS Vs. State of M.P.,
reported in (2007)7 SCC 625 deals with provisions of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947. There
presumption provided was under Section 4 and prerequisite for invoking it has been looked into.
The recent judgment, reported in (2018)9 SCC 242 - State of Gujrat Vs. Navinbhai Chandrakant
Joshi and Others deals with the Judgment 20 Cri.apeal609.2015.odt provisions of Section 20 of
Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, and it is observed that once possestion of bribe money is
established, burden shifts to accused to rebut it and standard to be applied is of preponderance of
probabilities.
50. As already found by me supra, accused (present appellant) has not explained how those 8
tainted notes with phenolphthalein powder could reach his shirt pocket or than Almirah in his flat.

During arguments, it could be noticed that efforts were made to point out how there is variance even
in the process of given signal. Submission is at one stage complainant says that he gave signal to first
Panch Shri Maudekar while at the other place, he mention that signal was given to raiding party.
This contention cannot in present facts, advance the case of appellant at all. Perusal of Panchanama
(Part-1) and Panchanama (Part-2) shows that preparations were made to trap accused on his table.
However, he told complainant to come with him to his residential flat situated in a different building
in vicinity, they therefore left the office and went to residential flat. Accused also told Shri Moudekar
not to accompany them. This unforeseen situation therefore may have created some practical
difficulties. Deposition of PW-2 Shri Maudekar shows, that he managed to hear the conversation by
standing near window of a flat and he could also see the signal given by complainant after coming
out of flat. Raiding party had also taken position and saw the signal. Small inconsistenties like one
mentioned supra, therefore, are not fatal.
51. Here failure of accused to discharge burden cast upon him by Section 20 of Prevention of
Corruption Act, 1988, clinches the controversy.
Judgment 21 Cri.apeal609.2015.odt As accused has not furnished any explanation, no fault can be
found with the judgment of conviction. There is no substance in the appeal. Appeal is accordingly
dismissed.
52. The learned counsel for appellant seeks continuation of bail for further period of 12 weeks. This
request is opposed by Adv. Mugdha Chandurkar for respondent.
53. As the matter is old, both the learned Advocates have assisted the system by appearing in
vacation and arguing the matter threadbare. The matter otherwise would not have been heard for
long time, after reopening of Court. In this situation, I am inclined to continue the bail orders
passed by this Court on 24.11.2005.
54. The said interim protection given to the appellant/accused shall remain in force for a period of
six weeks, after the appellant receives certified copy of this judgment delivered today. It shall cease
to operate automatically thereafter.
55. Thus, after the said period appellant shall be duty bound to surrender to his bail bounds, if there
are no court orders to the contrary.
56. The appeal is accordingly dismissed.
