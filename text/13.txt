fine of Rs. 500/- in default of payment of fine to suffer simple
imprisonment for one month.

He is also convicted for the offence

punishable under Section 457 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced
him to suffer rigorous imprisonment for three years and to pay fine of
Rs. 500/- in default of payment of fine to suffer simple imprisonment for
one month. Being aggrieved by the judgment of conviction, the accused
filed appeal before the Sessions Judge, Wardha vide Criminal Appeal
No. 12/2011. Said appeal came to be dismissed thereby confirming the
judgment of trial Court. Hence, the present revision.

2.

Heard learned counsel Shri Gaidhane for the accused/

applicant.

He has submitted that there is no evidence against the

accused/applicant to convict him. Learned trial Court wrongly invoked
the presumption under Section 114 of the Indian Evidence Act. There is
no eye witness to the incident. Hence, revision is liable to be allowed.

3.

Heard Shri Gangane, learned Additional Public Prosecutor

for the State/non-applicant. He has strongly supported the impugned
judgments and submitted that the accused was caught/arrested by
police immediately after commission of crime and he was found in
possession of stolen articles, therefore, presumption under Section 114

of the Indian Evidence Act was rightly invoked by the trial Court.

Accused is rightly convicted by the trial Court, therefore, present
revision is liable to be dismissed.

4.

The applicant was charge-sheeted for committing theft in

the night. He committed theft of gold ornaments i.e. mangalsutra of
about 30 gms, chaplakanti of about 30 gms, one golden ring of 4 gms
and cash of Rs. 2500/-. Learned counsel for accused has submitted that
there is no such report in respect of stolen cash of Rs. 2500/-. There is
no explanation as to how he was in possession of Rs. 2500/-. Therefore,
presumption is wrongly invoked by the trial Court.

5.

Complainant P.W. 3 Chandrashekhar Keshavrao Uchake has

stated in his evidence about the theft of golden ornaments and cash of
Rs. 2500/-.

He lodged report early in the morning on 30-4-2004.

Incident of theft took place in the night of 29-4-2004 and 30-4-2004. In
his report, complainant has specifically stated that Rs. 2500/- cash and
golden ornaments were removed by the thief from his house.
Admittedly, the report was lodged against the unknown person.

6.

After lodging the report, the accused was arrested

immediately in presence of P.W. 6. When accused was arrested, he was
found in possession of golden ornaments and cash of Rs. 2500/-. There
is no discrepancy in the amount and golden ornaments seized by the
police in presence of P.W. 6. P.W. 6 Avinash Raut is an independent

witness who has specifically stated that accused was arrested and that
time golden ornaments belonging to the complainant and cash of Rs.
2500/- were seized from the accused.

Complainant identified those

articles. Accused could not give any explanation about the possession of
stolen articles.

7.

Section 114 of the Indian Evidence Act reads as under.

114. Court may
Court may presume the
have happened, regard
events, human conduct
relation to the facts

presume existence of certain facts. - The
existence of any fact which it thinks likely to
being had to the common course of natural
and public and private business, in their
of the particular case.
Illustrations

The Court may presume -(a) That a man who is in possession of stolen goods soon
after the theft is either the thief or has received the goods knowing
them to be stolen, unless he can account for his possession;
---8.

As per Section 114 sub-clause (a), that a man who is in

possession of stolen goods soon after the theft is either the thief or has
received the goods knowing them to be stolen, unless he can account for
his possession. Accused has not given any account in respect of articles
seized from his possession.

Therefore, presumption under Section

114(a) of the Indian Evidence Act is rightly invoked by the trial
Court.

This presumption is not rebutted by the accused. P.W. 6 is

an independent witness.

He has specifically stated that golden

ornaments and cash of Rs. 2500/- were found in possession of accused.
Accused has not given any account of the same. Learned trial Court has
rightly invoked the presumption under Section 114 of the Indian
Evidence Act and rightly convicted the accused. Appellate Court has
also rightly evaluated the evidence on record and dismissed the appeal.
Therefore, I do not find any merit in the present revision and it is likely
to be dismissed.

9.

At this stage, learned counsel Shri Gaidhane for the accused

has submitted that accused was in jail for a period of six months and,
therefore, judicial discretion may kindly be used by allowing the present
revision. The accused was in jail for a considerable period i.e. for six
months. As per Section 380 of the Indian Penal Code, punishment is

provided to the extent of 7 years and shall also be liable to fine. The
punishment for offence punishable under Section 457 of the Indian
Penal Code is to the extent of 5 years and shall also be liable to fine.
The main offence is under Section 380 of the Indian Penal Code.
Learned counsel Shri Gaidhane has submitted that accused has already
paid fine amount. Hence, to meet the ends of justice, following order is
passed.
ORDER

(a) Revision is partly allowed.
