COMMON JUDGMENT

the learned Judge of the Special Court for trial of cases under Section Prevention of Corruption Act,
Trichy in S.C.No.118 of 2011 dated 18.04.2012.
2.Crl.A.(MD) No.205 of 2012 has been filed to set aside the acquittal of A2 dated 18.04.2012 in
Special Case No.118 of 2011 on the file of the Special Court for trial of cases under Prevention of
Corruption Act, Tiruchirappalli and convict the respondent / accused (A2) as charged.
http://www.judis.nic.in
3.The case of the prosecution is that the complainant M.Kandasamy, a resident of Thelungupatti
Village, Kulithalai Taluk was taken to Thogaimalai Police Station by A1 on 22.07.2006 at about
03.00 p.m., and was detained there for some time and enquired from 06.00 p.m., to 10.00 p.m., and
instructed him to come to the police station on the next day. Accordingly, on 23.07.2006 at about
12.00 noon, the defacto complainant went to the said police station. He was interrogated by the first
accused from 12.00 noon to 02.00 p.m., and was instructed to come to the police station once again
at 06.00 p.m., on the same day.
4.When the defacto complainant came to the police station at 06.00 p.m., on the same day, he was
interrogated and sent to his home at 09.00 p.m., by the first accused and at the time the appellant /
A1 demanded the defacto complainant to pay a sum of Rs.3,000/- as bribe for not registering any
case against the defacto complainant. He replied that he has no money. Then he was threatened by
the first accused by saying that he should pay a sum of Rs.3,000/- as bribe before the next night,
otherwise the hands and legs of the defacto complainant would be broken and his entire family
would be placed inside.
http://www.judis.nic.in
5.On 24.07.2006, the defacto complainant met the first accused in the said police station along with
witness Palaniyappan at about 08.15 p.m. He was enquired and was asked by him as to why the
other four persons did not come with him and for which he told that he brought a sum of Rs.3,000/as demanded by him. Then the defacto complainant was told by him that he should come tomorrow
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9022838/

2

A.Balasubramanian vs State Through on 28 January, 2019

with the other four persons and each one should bring a sum of Rs.3,000/-.
6.On 25.07.2006, when the defacto complainant met the first accused in the said police station at
about 07.40 p.m., along with the said Palaniyappan, he confirmed with the defacto complainant as
to whether he came with the demanded money and asked him to wait for some time. While they
were waiting at about 08.45 p.m., A2 came to the police station and went into the room of the
appellant / A1 and after that at about 08.50 p.m., the defacto complainant went into the room of the
appellant / A1 with the said official witness and met him in his room. At that time, A2 was sitting
opposite to the first accused. The appellant / A1 reiterated his earlier demand and directed the
defacto complainant to hand over the said amount to A2 and as directed the defacto complainant
handed over the said amount to the second accused, he accepted http://www.judis.nic.in the same
on behalf of A1 and hence, the appellant / A1 had committed an offence punishable under Sections
7, 13(2) r/w 13(1)
(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and the appellant / A2 had committed an offence
punishable under Section 12 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.
7.In order to prove the case of the prosecution, on the side of the prosecution, 11 witness were
examined, 26 documents were marked and 3 material objects were exhibited. After completing the
prosecution evidence, incriminating circumstances culled out from the prosecution witnesses were
put before the accused and the same has been denied as false. On the side of the defence, no oral and
documentary evidence were produced.
8.After completing the trial, hearing the arguments and considering the matter, the learned Special
Judge convicted A1 and acquitted A2. Against that judgment, A1 has filed an appeal before this
Court in Crl.A.(MD) No.91 of 2012 and the prosecution has filed an appeal in Crl.A.(MD) No.205 of
2012 against the acquittal of A2.
9.The learned counsel for the appellant in Crl.A.(MD) No.91 of 2012 would submit that the demand
has not been proved in this http://www.judis.nic.in case and the appellant / A1 interrogated the
defacto complainant / P.W2 and the witnesses P.Ws.,4, 5 and 6 and also some other persons in
connection with a theft of motor pump set and said to have demanded and accepted a bribe of
Rs.3,000/- from the defacto complainant. There is no dispute that the first accused had interrogated
the P.W2 and other in connection with a theft case as stated by the prosecution.
10.Further, the learned counsel would submit that after the completion of trap, the officials have not
obtained any statement from the accused and the same is violation of Rule 47 of the Vigilance
Manual, which is fatal to the case of the prosecution. P.Ws. 4, 5, 6 and 7 have clearly stated that they
had engaged A2 and he received the amount as professional fee and they have also admitted that A2
was present in the police station on 22.07.2006.
11.Further, P.W2 himself has stated that on 24.07.2006 the appellant / A1 had not demanded and
accepted the money and even on 25.07.2006, he has not demanded and accepted the money. Only
he asked where are the other persons and to bring them. Therefore, the learned Special Judge has
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9022838/

3

A.Balasubramanian vs State Through on 28 January, 2019

failed to appreciate the evidence and also given the finding that A1 demanded and accepted
http://www.judis.nic.in the money in the presence of P.W3 and P.W10, the Trap Laying Officer had
not recovered the money from A1. Only by his instructions, A2 received the money. Absolutely, there
is no evidence to show that A2 received the money for A1. A2 received the money only as
professional fee engaged by P.W2, which warrants interference of this Court.
12.Further, the learned counsel for the appellant in Crl.A.(MD) No.205 of 2012 would submit that
on 25.07.2006, when P.W2 met the appellant / A1 along with P.W3 at Thogaimalai Police Station,
the first accused is said to have reiterated his earlier demand and instructed the P.W2 to hand over
the bribe to the second accused, who is said to have received and accepted the same. The accused
have disputed the demand and acceptance of the bribe money and the M.O1 series and stated that
the said money was received by the second accused as professional fee from P.W2 at his office and
hence, the appellant has never demanded any money and never accepted any money. P.W1, the
Sanction Authority without applying his mind has accorded sanction.
13.The learned counsel for the respondent in Crl.A.(MD) No. 205 of 2012 would submit that the
respondent engaged one http://www.judis.nic.in Thangavel as Counsel to appear before the police
station for him. On 25.07.2006, when the Counsel came to his office, he received the money only as
professional fee. There is nothing wrong to appear before the police station on behalf of his client
and there is nothing wrong that the Advocate getting the legal fee from his client.
14.In this case, there is no knowledge about the bribe and further the amount has not been received
by A1. A2 received the amount from PW.2 only as professional fee for having engaged as Counsel for
PW.2. Therefore, the trial Court has rightly appreciated the evidence and found that there is no
knowledge about the bribe amount and the amount received only as professional fee, not a bribe and
there is no demand. When there is no demand, the mere recovery of tainted money does not
constitute the offence under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. When two views are possible,
the view, which is in favour of the accused, can be extended to the accused. Therefore, the benefit of
doubt has to be extended to the accused. Mere recovery of tainted money does not constitute the
offence. In this case, the prosecution has not proved the demand and acceptance.
http://www.judis.nic.in
15.The evidence of P.Ws., 2 and 3 clearly show that on 24.07.2006, the appellants have never
demanded and never accepted the money. Even P.W2 has voluntarily given the money to A1, A1
refused to accept the money and told to bring other suspected persons on 25.07.2006. Then on
25.07.2006, P.W2 came and gave the amount to A2 stating that professional fee.
16.Further, the learned counsel for the respondent in Crl.A. (MD) No.205 of 2012 would submit that
A2 has no knowledge about A1 demanded money. When P.W2 has given the money to A2, A2
received the same only as professional fee. There is no evidence to show that A2 has knowledge
about the bribe money and also A1 demanded the money and instructed A2 to receive the money.
There is no evidence to prove the same. Therefore, when two views are possible, the view, which is
favorable to the accused can be extended to him. Hence, the benefit of doubt can be extended to the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9022838/

4

accused.
17.In this case, since the trial Court acquitted A2, there is no perversity in the finding given by the
trial Court. It is for the prosecution to prove that there is a perversity in the finding given by the trial
Court. But, in this case, there is no perversity in the http://www.judis.nic.in finding of the trial
Court and there is no need for interference with the judgment of the trial Court and the trial Court
has rightly acquitted A2 and the prosecution has failed to prove that the charge levelled against A2
under Section 12 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, which does not warrant interference of
this Court.
18.The learned counsel for the State would submit that in order to avoid in filing of the false case
against P.W2, A1 demanded money as bribe and at his instructions A2 received the same. On
22.07.2006, the defacto complainant went to the police station. The documents Ex.P7 to Ex.P17
would clearly show that P.W2 and other witnesses had appeared before the police station on
22.07.2006 and at the time he demanded money and he was interrogated by A1 and was instructed
to come to the police station once again on the same day.
19.Then the defacto complainant went to the police station on 24.07.2006 and met A1, who in turn
asked as to why the other four persons did not come with him and for which he replied that he
brought a sum of Rs.3,000/- as demanded by him and A1 told that already there was a raid in the
police station and due to the same, he was not able to receive the money directly. Therefore, he
asked http://www.judis.nic.in him to wait outside for some time. Then, A1 called P.W2 and P.W3
and asked them to give the money to A2 and A2 was also waiting for all these things and he noticed
that A1 demanded money. Though there are materials against A1 and A2, the learned Special Judge
accepted the case of the prosecution against A1 alone and disbelieved the case against A2. From the
evidence of P.W2 and P.W3 coupled with P.W9 and P.W10, the prosecution has proved its case
against both the accused. But unfortunately, the learned Special Judge believed the case only against
A1 and acquitted A2, which warrants interference of this Court.
20.Heard the arguments advanced by both sides. Perused the records carefully.
21.It is the case of the prosecution that the defacto complainant was taken to Thogaimalai Police
Station by A1 on 22.07.2006 and was instructed to come to the police station on the next day.
Accordingly, on 23.07.2006, the defacto complainant went to the said police station. He was
interrogated by the appellant / A1 and was instructed to come to the police station again. Then he
was threatened by the first accused by saying that he should bring all the persons in the electric
motor theft case with a sum of Rs.3,000/- each as bribe within next day. http://www.judis.nic.in
22.Since he was not willing to give any bribe money, he approached the Vigilance and Anti
Corruption Office, Where he met P.W10, to file the complaint and thereafter, P.W10, received the
complaint and registered a case and summoned the independent witnesses and introduced P.W2 to
them and conducted the pre-trap demonstration proceedings and coated the phynopthalin powder
on the money, which was meant for giving to A1 and prepared the entrustment mahazar also and
noted down the serial numbers of the tainted money. Subsequently, after destroying all the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9022838/

5

A.Balasubramanian vs State Through on 28 January, 2019

phinopthalin test solution and washed their hands, P.W2 and P.W3 were asked to proceed to the
police station, in which A1 was working on 24.07.2006.
23.At the police station, when the defacto complainant met A1, the appellant / A1 enquired the
defacto complainant and asked him as to why the other four suspected persons in the electric motor
theft case did not come with him. He said that he was not aware about the other persons. Then he
was instructed to come on next day i.e., on 25.07.2006 along with others with a sum of Rs.3,000/each.
http://www.judis.nic.in
24.On 25.07.2006, when the defacto complainant met A1 in the said police station at about 07.40
p.m., along with the independent witness, he confirmed with the defacto complainant as to whether
he came with the money and asked him to wait for some time. While they were waiting at about
08.45 p.m., A2 came to the police station and went into the room of the appellant / A1 and after that
at about 08.50 p.m., the defacto complainant went into the room of the appellant / A1 with the said
official witness and met him in his room. At that time, A2 was sitting opposite to the first accused.
The appellant / A1 reiterated his earlier demand and directed the defacto complainant to hand over
the said amount to A2 and as directed, the defacto complainant handed over the said amount to the
second accused, he accepted the same on behalf of the first accused.
25.Thereafter, he came out from the office and showed the pre-arranged signals to the Trap Laying
Officer. Thereafter, P.W2 identified A1 and A2 and P.W1 introduced himself to A1 and A2. Trap
Laying Officer conducted the phenolpthalien test, which proved positive and thereafter, the tainted
money was recovered. Then recovery magazar was prepared and the matter was placed before the
Investigating Officer.
http://www.judis.nic.in
26.On reading of the evidence of P.W2, the defacto complainant narrated the events. On a perusal of
records, Ex.P7 to Ex.P17 clearly show that there was a complaint received against the theft of electric
motor and therefore, P.W2 was suspected with many other persons by the respondent police.
27.PW.2 had further deposed that since he was not willing to give the money as bribe, he filed a
complaint on 24.07.2006. Subsequently, after registering the case, the respondent police conducted
the pre trap demonstration proceedings and thereafter, the defacto complainant was told by A1 that
he should come to the police station next day i.e., on 25.07.2006 with the other four suspected
persons and each one should bring a sum of Rs.3,000/- and the same was reported before the Trap
Laying Officer and also he instructed P.W2 if he was interested would come on the next day i.e., on
25.07.2006 and on that day also he came and approached the Trap Laying Officer.
28.After completing the procedural formalities on 25.07.2006 at 12.45 p.m., P.W2 and P.W3 were
asked to go to the police station, where A1 is working and instruction was given, if A1 demanded
money, then only he should hand over the money to him http://www.judis.nic.in in the presence of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9022838/

6

A.Balasubramanian vs State Through on 28 January, 2019

P.W3. Thereafter, P.W2 had entered into the police station and again A1 asked about the other
suspected persons and P.W2 told that he was not aware of them and not concerned about the other
persons and then A1 told P.W2 to wait for some time at the outside of the police station because
recently there was a raid in the police station and due to the same he did not want to receive the
bribe money directly. Therefore, P.W2 and P.W3 were waiting outside the police station. Thereafter,
after reaching A2 to the police station, he went and sat opposite to A1, after 5 minutes A1 called
P.W2 and P.W3 and asked P.W2 to hand over the money to A2 by showing his hand and stated that
he would get from him later. Accordingly, P.W2 also handed over the tainted money to A2, A2 also
received the same and kept with him.
29.From a reading of the entire evidence of P.W2 and P.W3, P.W2 had never engaged A2 as his
counsel not only in this case but also in any other case. Therefore, there is no relationship between
A2 and P.W2 as counsel and client. Though A1 has stated that he has not demanded any money and
not accepted the money, no recovery has been made from him, at the same time, the bribe money
was transferred only in the police station in the presence of A1 and from the evidence of P.W2 and
P.W3, the prosecution has http://www.judis.nic.in clearly proved its case that A1 demanded money
from P.W2 and he wanted to receive the bribe money from the other suspected persons also, who
were all alleged to have been suspected in the electric motor theft case. Since the other persons have
not come on 24.07.2006, A1 did not receive the money and told him that if the other persons do not
come with a sum of Rs.3,000/- as bribe, he would register the case against P.W2. So, in the name of
enquiry, A1 called the persons and demanded money for not registering the case against P.W2.
30.From the evidence of P.W3, it is seen that he is neither the friend of P.W2 nor working in the
office of the Trap Laying Team and he is the independent witness. He has clearly stated that when
he went along with P.W2 on 24.07.2006, A1 demanded money and asked as to whether P.W2 has
brought the money and told him to come on the next day i.e., on 25.07.2006 and bring the other
suspected persons also. On 25.07.2006, A1 demanded money and at the time he has ascertained
from P.W2 as to whether he has brought the bribe money. When P.W2 gave the money to A1, he told
that since there was a raid in the police station in the recent past, he did not want to receive the
money directly. He asked P.W2 and P.W3 to wait for some time. After A2 reaching the office of A1
http://www.judis.nic.in was sitting opposite to A1. 5 minutes later he called P.W2 inside the office of
A1 and at the time again they reiterated the demand and ascertained as to whether P.W2 has
brought the money. As per the direction of A1, P.W2 and P.W3 were waiting outside the police
station and subsequently A2 received the money from P.W2 and A2 was not disputed the same and
P.W2 and P.W3 have clearly stated that A1 demanded money for not registering a false case against
P.W2. P.W2 has not engaged A2 as his counsel either for the said electric motor theft case or in any
other case. Though he has received the money on behalf of A1, A1 demanded bribe money in order to
avoid any complication, he received the tainted money through A2. The money received by A2 was
not for him it is only for A1. From the evidence of P.W2 and P.W3, it is clear that A1 told P.W2 by
showing his hand towards A2, who was sitting just opposite to A1 that give to A2 and he would
receive from him.
31.Under these circumstances, on reading of the entire evidence of P.W2, after showing the pre
arranged signals, the Trap Laying team entered into the police station and they also conducted the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9022838/

7

A.Balasubramanian vs State Through on 28 January, 2019

phynopthalin test and the result is also positive. Therefore, it is clear that A1 received the money
from P.W2 through A2. http://www.judis.nic.in
32.The learned counsel for A2 would submit that A2 was neither arrested nor signature was
obtained from him in the mahazar, which shows that A2 received the money only as professional
fee. Since he was not arrested on the said day, no signature was obtained from A2 in the magazars,
which shows that A2 has not committed any offence as alleged by the prosecution.
33.On reading of the suggestion put before P.W2, P.W2 handed over the money to A2, for having
engaged A2 and A2 has taken the stand that A2 received the money only as professional fee and not
as bribe money.
34.The evidence of P.W3 clearly shows that A1 demanded money on 24.07.2006 and on 25.07.2006
A2 received the money from P.W2 only for A1 as bribe money and not professional fee and P.W2 has
not engaged A2 as his counsel at any point of time not only in the said theft case but also any other
cases. In the absence of any materials to show that he was engaged by P.W2 as his counsel, the
defence taken by A2 is not acceptable.
35.On a conjoint reading of the materials placed before this Court, the entire evidence and the
witnesses, P.Ws.,5, 6 and 7, the http://www.judis.nic.in defence that on 22.07.2006, P.W2 asked A2
to stand as his counsel for defending his case. Since P.Ws., 5, 6 and 7 were also the suspected
persons, they are within the jurisdiction of A1 and that there is no documentary evidence to show
that P.W2 engaged A2 as his counsel not only in the said theft case and also any other cases, pending
before the police station, in which A1 was working. Under these circumstances, there is a perversity
in the appreciation of evidence of the prosecution against A2 and wrongly acquitted him.
36.On reading of the entire materials placed before this Court and considering the arguments
advanced by the learned counsel on either side, absolutely there is no quarrel with the legal
proposition in the referred to judgments. But in this case on hand, on reading of the entire materials
especially Ex.P7 to Ex.P17 have been recovered from the police station and the evidence of P.Ws., 2,
3, 4 and 10 clearly show that P.W2 was taken to the police station for enquiry in a theft case. At the
time, A1 demanded money and also accepted the same through A2 and therefore, A2 has committed
the offence and he was not engaged by P.W2 as his counsel not only in the said theft case and also
any other cases. Therefore, the defence taken by the accused is not believable. The defence taken by
the A-2 is only an afterthought and in order to escape from the clutch of the http://www.judis.nic.in
law, he has made a false defence without any substance. Mere taking bald defence without any
material is not acceptable.
37.Under these circumstances, this Court finds that A1 and A2 have committed the offence and on a
reading of the entire materials especially the witnesses P.Ws., 2, 3, 4 and 10, the prosecution has
proved its case beyond any reasonable doubt against A1 and A2.
38.The learned counsel for the accused would submit that no statement was recorded from the
accused soon after the completion of trap, the same is violated the Rule 47 of the Vigilance Manual.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/9022838/

8

A.Balasubramanian vs State Through on 28 January, 2019

The Vigilance Manual is only a guideline and the same is directory and not mandatory. Mere non
recording of the statement as per the rules in the manual is not vitiating the case of the prosecution.
39.The prosecution evidence clearly shows that A1 demanded money initially and thereafter,
received the same as bribe through A2. Therefore, the violation of Rule 47 or any other Rule of the
Vigilance Manual will not vitiate the case. Regarding the non application of mind by Sanction
Authority is concerned, even though P.W1 has stated in his evidence that he had perused the
statement of the accused, it is not the sole ground to acquit the accused when
http://www.judis.nic.in the Sanction Authority has gone through the entire materials and accorded
sanction. On reading of the sanction order and the evidence of P.W1 shows that he has applied his
mind before according the sanction. Therefore, there is nothing wrong in the sanction accorded by
P.W1.
40.The demand is proved through P.W2 and P.W3 and further the acceptance is also proved though
P.W2 and P.W3 in the manner known to law by the prosecution. The tainted money was also
recovered from A2 and he stated that he received the money from P.W2 as professional fee. The
same was not proved with substitutive materials that he was engaged by P.W2 when P.W2 denied
about his engagement. Therefore, Section 20 of the Act, apply to this case. No doubt the said legal
presumption is rebuttable, it is for the accused to rebut the presumption that the recovered money is
not a bribe money. On reading of the entire evidence, the Court below has not appreciated the entire
materials in toto.
41.On reading of the entire materials placed before this Court, the prosecution has proved its case
with cogent evidence that for not filing the false case against P.W2. A1 demanded money at the
http://www.judis.nic.in time of occurrence, since there was a frequent raid in the police station in
order to escape from the clutches of the law, he received the money through A-2.
42.Therefore, on 25.07.2006, he confirmed with the defacto complainant as to whether he had
brought the money and asked him to wait for some time. While they were waiting, A2 came to the
police station and went into the room of the A1 and sitting opposite to him after that the de facto
complainant went into the room of A1 with the said official witness and met him in his room. At that
time, A2 was sitting opposite to the first accused. A1 reiterated his earlier demand and directed the
de facto complainant to hand over the said amount to A2 and as directed, the de facto complainant
handed over the said amount to the second accused, he accepted the same on behalf of the first
accused and kept the money in his pocket. There is no evidence to show that A2 was engaged by
P.W2 as his counsel not only in the said theft case and also for any other case, which was pending
before the said police station. The explanation offered by the accused was neither reasonable not
satisfactory. Fact is that A2 had received the money in the police station as instructed by A1, who
was just sitting opposite to him and in the absence of a reasonable explanation as
http://www.judis.nic.in to how the tainted money came to his possession then would be a
presumption that he accepted the bribe and Section 20 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 is
attracted.
