set up a case that his wife has committed suicide that
should not detract the court from considering the case
as per law.

Expatiating he contended that appellant

must be extended the benefit of exception 4 to Section

of Tamil Nadu
(3) 1998(4) SCC 336 State of U.P. v. Lakhmi
He would also submit that the Court has found that the
appellant has suffered injuries. This strengthened the
appellant’s case based on their being a quarrel and
therefore this is a fit case where the conviction must
be altered from Section 302 of the IPC to Section 304
Part II of the IPC. He points out that the court has
acquitted him of the charge under Section 498A which
means there was no matrimonial cruelty practised by the
appellant on his late wife.

the

matrimonial home of the deceased turned hostile.

PW7 to PW9 were the neighbours.

These witnesses turned hostile.

PW1, the brother of

the deceased and PW 10, the mother of the deceased
undoubtedly abided by the prosecution version.

The

appellate Court noted that the appellant did not deny
the fact that he and his wife were available in the bed
room in the night.

He did not take up any definite

stand as to how the injuries were sustained by the
deceased.

At this point of time, it is apposite to

refer to the injuries.

The following are the ante-

mortem injuries which are noted in Exh.P9 post-mortem
certificate which stood proved by PW16, Dr. Siva Sudan:
“1. Contusion 3x3x0.5 cm on the forehead
in midline, 4 cm above the root of nose.
2. Abrasion 1x0.2cm vertical on left
side of face, 3cm on front of lobule of

We may further notice that when the Principal

Sessions Judge took up the matter after remand, he has
entered the following findings inter alia. It was found
that the death was an immediate result of the blunt
force applied on the neck of the deceased.

The learned

Judge went on to find that a case under Section 498A
was not made out.

The appellant and the deceased-wife

were living in a separate bed room.

PW1 noted marks

of physical violence on the body of the deceased.

PW1,

in his chief examination deposed that the brother of
the appellant and two others informed that his sister
was hospitalised due to sore throat.

Later he was

informed that she died due to hanging. He has testified
that he saw swelling on the forehead, contused abrasion
on the left cheek of his sister apart from marks of

throttling on the neck and nail marks on those regions.

The Court also noticed that the incident

happened in the bed room of the appellant and that too
during night and there was no other person in the room.
Therefore, the appellant had a responsibility under

The appellant was

found as having committed murder by throttling and the
theory of suicide was found unacceptable.

The High

Court also noted the case of the appellant that his
wife committed suicide at 1.30 a.m. by hanging on the
window grill of their room.

The High Court agreed that

only hypothesis possible was homicide by the appellant.

We can safely conclude on the basis of the material

appellant was a completely false plea.

10. In Partap v. State of Uttar Pradesh 1976 (2) SCC
798, there was an exchange of hot words between two
persons in regard to water.

The dispute escalated and

a state of acrimony was attained.

A gun was fired.

The victim of the gun shot injury lost his life.

The

plea of the appellant was that deceased was about to
12

strike him with the balla and he fired a shot in self
defence.

Justice M.H. Beg wrote a concurring judgment

agreeing with Justice R.S. Sarkaria that the appellant
had established a case that he has acted in his self
defence and held as follows:

“30. The question which arises in this
case is: Even if the defence version is
not held to be fully established by a
balance of probabilities, were there not
sufficient pointers in evidence of what
was probably the truth which leaked out
from some statements of the prosecution
witnesses themselves? They had indicated
the bellicose and threatening attitude of
Ram Nath while he was advancing. Did this
not tend to corroborate the defence
version that he was actually advancing
menacingly armed with a bhala poised for
an attack with it when he was shot at?
31. It was held in the case of Rishi Kesh
Singh by a majority of a Full Bench of
nine Judges of the Allahabad High Court
explaining and relying upon the decisions
of this Court discussed there (at p. 51):
“The accused person who pleads an exception
is entitled to be acquitted if upon a
consideration of the evidence as a whole
(including the evidence given in support of
the plea of the general exception) a
reasonable doubt is created in the mind of
the Court about the guilt of the accused.”

13

In
that
case,
the
result
of
a
consideration of the decision of this
Court in relation to the provisions of
Section 105 of the Evidence Act was summed
up by me as follows (at pages 97-98):
“... an accused's plea of an exception may
reach one of three not sharply demarcated
stages, one succeeding the other, depending
upon the effect of the whole evidence in the
case judged by the standard of a prudent man
weighing
or
balancing
probabilities
carefully. These stages are: firstly, a
lifting
of
the
initial
obligatory
presumption given at the end of Section 105
of the Act; secondly, the creation of a
reasonable doubt about the existence of an
ingredient of the offence; and thirdly a
complete proof of the exception by ‘a
preponderance of probability’, which covers
even a slight tilt of the balance of
probability in favour of the accused's plea.
The accused is not entitled to an acquittal
if his plea does not get beyond the first
stage. At the second stage, he becomes
entitled to acquittal by obtaining a bare
benefit of doubt. At the third stage, he is
undoubtedly entitled to an acquittal. This,
in my opinion, is the effect of the majority
view
in Parbhoo’s
case which
directly
relates to first two stages only. The Supreme
Court decisions have considered the last two
stages so far, but first stage has not yet
been dealt with directly or separately there
in any case brought to our notice.”

32. Provisions of Section 105 of the
Evidence Act, which are applicable in
such cases, contain what are really two
kinds of burden of the accused who sets
up an exception: “firstly, there is the
onus laid down of proving the existence
of circumstances
bringing the case within any of the General
Exceptions in the Penal Code, 1860, or, within
any special exception or proviso contained in
14

any other part of the same Code, or in any law
defining the offence,”

and, secondly, there is the burden of
introducing or showing evidence which
results from the last part of the
provision which says that “the Court
shall presume the absence of such
circumstances”.
The
effect
of
this
obligatory presumption at the end of
Section 105 of the Evidence Act is that
the Court must start by assuming that no
facts exist which could be taken into
consideration for considering the plea of
self-defence as an exception to the
criminal liability which would otherwise
be there. But, when both sides have led
evidence of their respective versions,
the accused can show, from any evidence
on the record, whether tendered by the
prosecution or the defence, that the
mandatory presumption is removed. The
last mentioned burden is not really a
burden of establishing the plea fully but
of either introducing or of showing the
existence of some evidence to justify the
taking up of the plea. The burden
resulting from the obligatory presumption
is not difficult to discharge and its
removal may not be enough for an
acquittal.”
11. In Periasami and Another v. State of T.N.; 1996
(6) SCC 457, accused, two in number, were alleged to
have attacked the deceased.

Though the Sessions Judge

acquitted the accused, the High Court convicted the two
appellants under Section 302 read with Section 34 IPC
and another accused under Section 324 IPC.

This Court
15

found that the injuries were caused by the appellant
with lethal weapons.

Dealing with the contention that

offence would not be above 304 Part I, the Court noted
that though the right of private defence was not set
up under Section 313 Cr.PC., absence of such a plea
would not stand in the way of the defence based on the
exception being set up was the contention taken by the
appellant.

The Court noted as follows:

“17. While
dealing
with
the
said
alternative contention we have to bear in
mind Section 105 of the Evidence Act,
1872. A rule of burden of proof is
prescribed therein that the burden is on
the accused to prove the existence of
circumstances bringing the case within
any of the exceptions “and the Court shall
presume
the
absence
of
such
circumstances”. The said rule does not
whittle down the axiomatic rule of burden
(indicated in Section 101) that the
prosecution must prove that the accused
has
committed
the
offence
charged
against. The traditional rule that it is
for prosecution to prove the offence
beyond reasonable doubt applies in all
criminal
cases
except
where
any
particular statute prescribes otherwise.
The legal presumption created in Section
105 with the words “the Court shall
presume
the
absence
of
such
circumstances”
is
not
intended
to
displace the aforesaid traditional burden
of the prosecution. It is only where the
prosecution has proved its case with
16

reasonable certainty that the court can
rest on the presumption regarding absence
of circumstances bringing the case within
any of the exceptions. This presumption
helps the court to determine on whom is
the burden to prove facts necessary to
attract the exception and an accused can
discharge the burden by “preponderance of
probabilities” unlike the prosecution.
But there is no presumption that an
accused is the aggressor in every case of
homicide. If there is any reasonable
doubt,
even
from
the
prosecution
evidence, that the aggressor in the
occurrence was not the accused but would
have been the deceased party, then
benefit of that reasonable doubt has to
be extended to the accused, no matter he
did not adduce any evidence in that
direction.
18. The above legal position has been
succinctly stated by Subbarao, J. (as he
then was) in a case where an accused
pleaded the exception under Section 84
IPC
(Dahyabhai
Chhaganbhai
Thakkar v. State of Gujarat [AIR 1964 SC
1563 : (1964) 2 Cri LJ 472]):
“The prosecution, therefore, in a case
of
homicide
shall
prove
beyond
reasonable doubt that the accused
caused
death
with
the
requisite
intention described in Section 299 of
the Penal Code, 1860. This general
burden never shifts and it always
rests on the prosecution. … If the
material placed before the court, such
as, oral and documentary evidence,
presumptions, admissions or even the
prosecution evidence, satisfies the
test of ‘prudent man’ the accused will
have
discharged
his
burden.
The
evidence
so
placed
may
not
be
17

sufficient to discharge the burden
under Section 105 of the Evidence Act,
but it may raise a reasonable doubt in
the mind of a Judge as regards one or
other of the necessary ingredients of
the offence itself.”
20. Keeping the above legal position in
mind, we scrutinised the evidence to
ascertain whether the deceased could have
been the aggressor. Neither PW 1 nor PW 2
could say how the occurrence started. The
possibility that before they reached the
place, some events would have already
taken place cannot be ruled out. PW 1 and
PW 2 overheard the squeal of a pig. They
also overheard the sound of a quarrel.
When they reached the scene they saw the
carcass of a slain pig lying nearby. The
motive suggested by the prosecution was
sufficient for the deceased as well to
entertain animus towards the second
appellant. Further, both sides would have
confronted with each other on that
morning
abruptly
without
any
prior
knowledge or inkling that the deceased
might go to the plantain grove at the
crucial time for answering the call of
nature.”
(emphasis supplied)

12. The Court found that the circumstances were more
than enough to install a reasonable doubt that the
accused would have picked up a quarrel with the second
appellant and other events followed and on this basis

the

We may notice

It reads as under:

“8. As a legal proposition we cannot agree
with the High Court that statement of an
accused recorded under Section 313 of the
Code does not deserve any value or utility
if it contains inculpatory admissions.
The need of law for examining the accused
with
reference
to
incriminating
circumstances appearing against him in
prosecution
evidence
is
not
for
observance of a ritual in a trial, nor is
it a mere formality. It has a salutary
purpose. It enables the court to be
apprised of what the indicted person has
to say about the circumstances pitted
against him by the prosecution. Answers
to the questions may sometimes be flat
19

denial or outright repudiation of those
circumstances. In certain cases the
accused would offer some explanations to
incriminative circumstances. In very rare
instances the accused may even admit or
own incriminating circumstances adduced
against him, perhaps for the purpose of
adopting legally recognised defences. In
all such cases the court gets the
advantage of knowing his version about
those aspects and it helps the court to
effectively appreciate and evaluate the
evidence in the case. If an accused admits
any incriminating circumstance appearing
in evidence against him there is no
warrant that those admissions should
altogether be ignored merely on the
ground that such admissions were advanced
as a defence strategy.”
(emphasis supplied)
14. We, therefore, have no hesitation in holding that
a statement made by the accused under Section 313 Cr.PC
even

it

contains

inculpatory

admissions

cannot

be

ignored and the Court may where there is evidence
available proceed to enter a verdict of guilt.

In the

aforesaid case he specifically stated that he murdered
his wife with a Kunda and not with Phali.

The Court

noted further that there was no merit in the defence
sought to be set up under Section 84 of the penal code.
However, the Court noted as follows:

20

16. …..However, we have noticed that the
accused had adopted another alternative
defence which has been suggested during
cross-examination
of
prosecution
witnesses i.e. his wife and PW 2 (Ramey)
were together on the bed during the early
hours of the date of occurrence. If that
suggestion deserves consideration we have
to turn to the question whether the
benefit of Exception I to Section 300 of
the IPC should be extended to him?
17. The law is that burden of proving such
an exception is on the accused. But the
mere fact that the accused adopted
another alternative defence during his
examination under Section 313 of the IPC
without referring to Exception I of
Section 300 of IPC is not enough to deny
him of the benefit of the exception, if
the Court can cull out materials from
evidence pointing to the existence of
circumstances leading to that exception.
It is not the law that failure to set up
such a defence would foreclose the right
to rely on the exception once and for all.
It is axiomatic that burden on the accused
to prove any fact can be discharged either
through defence evidence or even through
prosecution
evidence
by
showing
a
preponderance of probability.
18. In the above context, we deem it
useful to ascertain what possibly would
have prompted the accused to kill his
wife. The prosecution case as noted
above, is that the accused was not welldisposed to his wife as she was always
speaking against his drinking habits. We
are inclined to think that, while
considering the manner in which he had
21

suddenly pounced upon his young wife who
bore two children to him and smashed her
head during the early hours, he would have
had some other strong cause which
probably would have taken place within a
short time prior to the murder. Certain
broad features looming large in evidence
help us in that line of thinking.”
15. The Court went on to hold on analysing the evidence
that the features show that the appellant had seen
something lascivious between his wife and PW2.

This

led the Court to find that the respondent was entitled
to benefit of Exception I to Section 300 IPC and the
respondent was convicted under Section 304 Part I of
IPC.

16. There can be no quarrel with the principles which
have been laid down.

Principles of law however cannot

be appreciated or applied irrespective of the facts
obtaining in a particular case.

There can be no doubt

that the burden to prove that the case is made out in
a particular case is on the prosecution unless the law
declares otherwise.

case which is sought to be set up before us revolves
around the applicability of exception 4 to Section 3000
IPC which involves inter alia a sudden fight following
a quarrel.

What is conspicuous by its absence is a

any such quarrel between him and his wife.

22. Valiant attempt is made by Mr. Renjith B. Marar,
learned counsel for the appellant to bring the case
within the scope of Section 304 Part-I.

He emphasised

that proceeding that it is culpable homicide and that
he had the intention also to cause the death of his
wife, it could still be brought under Section 304 Part26

We

are unable to see how exception I to Section 300 IPC

Exception I requires

deprivation of power of control by the accused by

The grave and

sudden provocation must be given by the deceased.

No

doubt, if death is caused of any other person by virtue
of the sudden provocation, by mistake or accident,

Nothing is brought out before

us in the evidence to even faintly establish the giving
of any provocation leave alone a grave and sudden
provocation.

24. The case of exception 4 is no different in our view
in its inapplicability to the facts.

There is no

material for us to come to the conclusion that there
occurred a sudden quarrel leading to a sudden fight
going by the version furnished by the appellant in his
written statement under 313 Cr.PC which statement
recites that he fell fast asleep.

also

Till such time there

is no hint even of any sudden fight or sudden quarrel.
It must also be appreciated that under Section 106 of
the Evidence Act facts within the exclusive knowledge
of the appellant as to what transpired within the
privacy of their bed room even must be established by
the appellant.

The fact that appellant went about

setting up of a palpably false case even at the late
stage of filing the written statement under 313 after
28

remand trying to attribute death by hanging by his wife
falsely.
25. We may no doubt notice Section 86 of the IPC.
Section 86 reads as follows:
“86. Offence requiring a particular
intent or knowledge committed by one who
is intoxicated.—In cases where an act
done is not an offence unless done with a
particular knowledge or intent, a person
who does the act in a state of
intoxication shall be liable to be dealt
with as if he had the same knowledge as
he would have had if he had not been
intoxicated, unless the thing which
intoxicated him was administered to him
without his knowledge or against his
will.”

26. Section 86 of the IPC enunciates presumption that
despite intoxication which is not covered by the last
limb of the provision, the accused person cannot ward
off the consequences of his act.

A dimension however

about intoxication may be noted.

Section 86 begins by

referring to an act which is not an offence unless done
with a particular knowledge or intent.

Thereafter, the

law giver refers to a person committing the act in a
state of intoxication. It finally attributes to him
knowledge as he would have if he were not under the
29

state of intoxication except undoubtedly, in cases
where the intoxicant was administered to him either
against his will or without his knowledge.

What about

an act which becomes an offence if it is done with a
specific intention by a person who is under the state
of

intoxication?

Section

86

does

not

attribute

intention as such to an intoxicated man committing an
act which amounts to an offence when the act is done
by a person harbouring a particular intention.

This

question has engaged the attention of this Court in the
decision in Basdev v. State of Pepsu

AIR 1956 SC 488.

In the said case the appellant, a retired military
official went to attend a wedding.

The appellant was

very drunk. He asked a young boy to step aside a little
so that he could occupy a convenient
did not budge.

seat.

The boy

The appellant fired from a pistol, he

had with him, in the abdomen of the boy which proved
fatal.

This Court inter alia held as follows:
“4. It is no doubt true that while the
first part of the section speaks of intent
or knowledge, the latter part deals only
with knowledge and a certain element of
doubt in interpretation may possibly be
felt by reason of this omission. If in
voluntary drunkenness knowledge is to be
30

presumed in the same manner as if there
was no drunkenness, what about those
cases where mens rea is required.
Are we at liberty to place intent on the
same footing, and if so, why has the
section omitted intent in its latter
part? This is not the first time that the
question comes up for consideration. It
has been discussed at length in many
decisions and the result may be briefly
summarised as follows:5. So far as knowledge is concerned, we
must attribute to the intoxicated man the
same knowledge as if he was quite sober.
But so far as intent or intention is
concerned, we must gather it from the
attending general circumstances of the
case paying due regard to the degree
intoxication. Was the man beside his mind
altogether for the time being?
If so it would not be possible to fix him
with the requisite intention. But if he
had not gone so deep in drinking, and from
the facts it could be found that he knew
what he was about, we can apply the rule
that a man is presumed to intend the
natural consequences of his act or acts.
6. Of course, we have to distinguish
between motive, intention and knowledge.
Motive is something which prompts a man
to form an intention and knowledge is an
awareness of the consequences of the act.
In many cases intention and knowledge
merge into each other and mean the same
thing more or less and intention can be
presumed from knowledge. The demarcating
line between knowledge and intention is
no doubt thin but it is not difficult to
31

perceive that they connote different
things. Even in some English decisions,
the three ideas are used interchangeably
and this has led to a certain amount of
confusion.”
(emphasis supplied)

27. In this case there is no evidence about how drunk
the appellant was or whether the drunkenness in any way
stood in the way of the appellant forming the requisite
intention.

There is also gap between the time when he

was allegedly found drinking and the time of the crime.
Moreover, in his 313 statement, according to him, he
has stated that he fell fast asleep and he got up to
see his wife hanging. The principle that would apply
therefore is that appellant can be presumed to have
intended the natural consequences of his act.

28. As far as the contention that appellant should be
handed down conviction under Section 304, Part-I, we
are not impressed by the said argument.

As to what

constitutes murder under Section 300 of the IPC and
what constitutes culpable homicide amounting to murder
has been a vexed issue and the subject matter of a
large body of case law. Section 300 of the IPC declares
32

that except in those cases

which are specifically

which have been specifically laid down.

There are

commonly referred to as firstly, secondly, thirdly and
fourthly under Section 300 of the IPC. If the intention
of the Legislature was that culpable homicide would
amount to murder if it did not fall in any of the five
exceptions enumerated in Section 300 of the IPC.

What

was the need for the Legislature to ‘waste words’ as
it were by declaring that culpable homicide is murder
if the act fell within any of the 4 clauses in Section
300 of the IPC?

Punnayya and Another 1976(4) SCC 382 inter alia held
as follows:

33

21. From the above conspectus, it emerges
that whenever a court is confronted with
the question whether the offence is
‘murder’
or
‘culpable
homicide
not
amounting to murder’, on the facts of a
case, it will be convenient for it to
approach the problem in three stages. The
question to be considered at the first
stage would be, whether the accused has
done an act by doing which he has caused
the death of another. Proof of such causal
connection between the act of the accused
and the death, leads to the second stage
for considering whether that act of the
accused amounts to “culpable homicide” as
defined in Section 299. If the answer to
this question is prima facie found in the
affirmative, the stage for considering
the operation of Section 300 of the Penal
Code, is reached. This is the stage at
which the court should determine whether
the facts proved by the prosecution bring
the case within the ambit of any of the
four clauses of the definition of
“murder” contained in Section 300. If the
answer to this question is in the negative
the offence would be “culpable homicide
not amounting to murder”, punishable
under the first or the second part of
Section 304, depending, respectively, on
whether the second or the third clause of
Section 299 is applicable. If this
question is found in the positive, but
the case comes within any of the
exceptions enumerated in Section 300, the
offence would still be “culpable homicide
not amounting to murder”, punishable
under the first part of Section 304, of
the Penal Code.
(emphasis supplied)
34

29. As far as this case is concerned, there can be no
doubt that the act which led to the death has been
committed by the appellant.

We can safely proceed on

the basis also that it amounts to culpable homicide.
Going by the circumstances present in this case and in
particular injuries suffered, it is quite clear that
the act would fall within the scope of Section 300 of
the IPC.

If the act results in culpable homicide which

does not amount to murder, then and then alone the
question arises of applying Section 304 Part-I or PartII as the case may be.

Appellant cannot extricate

himself from the consequence of his act attracting the
ingredients of murder by pointing out Section 304 Part
I which also contains the expression, “the act with the
intention to cause death’.
different.

The implications are vastly

Section 304 of the IPC would apply only in

a case where culpable homicide is not murder.

If the

act amounting to culpable homicide satisfies any of the
four criteria to bring it under the offence of murder,
being mutually exclusive, there can be no scope for

35

applying Section 304 of the IPC.

On the other hand,

if the act is culpable homicide as falling in any of
the five exceptional circumstances mentioned in Section
300 and then it would amount to culpable homicide not
amounting to murder.

In cases where the accused is

able to establish he is entitled to the benefit of any
of the exceptions under Section 300 then his case may
be considered under Part-I or Part-II of Section 304
of the IPC depending on whether the act which caused
the culpable homicide was done with the intention of
causing death or with knowledge that it is likely to
cause death.

That apart cases of culpable homicide

which do not attract any of the four situations under
Section 300 would still be culpable homicide to be
dealt with under Section 304 of the IPC.

However, if

the case falls under any of the four limbs of Section
300, there would be no occasion to allow Section 304
to have play.

If the act which caused the death and

which is culpable homicide is done with the intention
of causing death, then it would be murder.

This is

however subject to the act not being committed in

30. The act of the appellant in the facts of this case
clearly show that he has throttled his wife.

None of

the exceptions in Section 300 are attracted.

The act

amounts to murder within the meaning of Section 300 of
the IPC.

The upshot of the above discussion is, we see

no reason to interfere with the impugned judgment.

The

appeal stands dismissed.
