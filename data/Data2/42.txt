2018 upon calling the cleaner Rajnikant Mane complainant came to
know that the vehicle was loaded with sugar bags weighing around
25 tons and the consignment was scheduled to be transported to
Kerala. On 16th October, 2018 complainant tried to know the
whereabouts of the cleaner by calling him on phone. On 17 th October,
2018 complainant received call from Amboli Police Station informing
him that the truck bearing No. KA 22 B-8526 is found with a dead
body in it and sugar bags were missing. The investigation was
conducted and charge-sheet is filed. The applicant was arrested on

3.

conspired with accused No. 7 & 8 and murdered Rajnikant Mane.
The stolen sugar was sold to accused No.7 & 8. It is alleged that

accused No.1. The alleged role attributed to applicant will not attract
Section 302, 394, 396, 201, 120(B) of IPC. At the most the applicant
can be protected as received of stolen property.

5.

Learned APP submitted that prior to the incident, during

incident and after offence there were calls between applicant and
prime-accused. C.C.T.V. footage shows that the stolen sugar is
unloaded in the premises of applicant. Thus, it can be inferred that
there was conspiracy between the applicant and the other accused.

6.

In the absence of cogent evidence, it is difficult to accept that

applicant is party to conspiracy to commit robbery and murder. At
the most, the applicant attributed with charge under Section 411
which has been invoked while filing of charge-sheet. It is contended
that there are no calls between applicant and accused No.1, who is
involved in the robbery and

murder.

Assuming there are calls

between accused no inference can be drawn that applicant had
conspired to commit robbery and murder. It is contended that there
were calls between applicant and accused No.8. Investigation is
completed and charge-sheet is filed. There are no criminal
antecedents against the applicant. Hence, case for grant of bail is
made out.
