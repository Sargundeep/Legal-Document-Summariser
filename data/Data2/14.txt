PC :

1. The applicants in all these applications are seeking bail under Section 439 of Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973 in connection with CR No.I-07 of 2017 registered with Kongaon Police Station for
offences under Sections 395, 365, 201, 120B, 411, 412 of Indian Penal Code r/w Sections 3(I),(II),
3(2), 3(4) of Maharashtra Control of Organized Crime Act (`MCOC Act'). The applicant in Bail
Application No.3352 of 2018 was arrested on 13th February 2017. The applicant in Bail Application
No.1510 of 2018 was arrested on 8th March 2017, whereas applicant in Bail Application No.1924 of
2018 is arrested on 8th March 2017.
2. The prosecution case is that the complainant is resident of Kalyan, District Thane. He is employee
of company viz Proconnect Supply Solutions Limited as Assistant General Manager. The said
company is having its godown at Gala Nos.1 to 10, Building No.E/6, behind Cipla Company,
Pimpalas Road, Pimplas Gaon, Tal.Bhiwandi wherein electronic goods of various companies are
stored. About 50 persons are working in the said godown. Several security guards are deputed for
security in the said godown. On 10-1-2017 the complainant received telephonic call from the security
guard informing him that theft has taken place in the godown of the company. The complainant
immediately rushed to the spot. On reaching the godown it was revealed that shutter no.11 of the
godown was broken and the accused had committed theft of mobile phones, I-Pods, Chargers and
USB cables valued at Rs.42,19,490/-. The complainant thereafter lodged complaint in respect of
said theft with Kongaon Police Station against unknown persons. The offence 3 of 6
904.BA.3352.2018.doc as stated hereinabove was registered. The spot panchanama was recorded.
Subsequently the accused were arrested. Approval was sought for application of provisions of MCOC
Act in accordance with Section 23(1) of the said Act. Sanction was accorded for application of
provisions of MCOC Act. The applicants were remanded to custody from time to time. On
completing investigation charge sheet has been filed.
3. Learned counsel representing the accused submitted that the provisions of MCOC Act are not
attracted in the present case. There is no evidence to show that the applicant were the members of
organized crime syndicate. The prosecution is relying upon the confession of one of the accused
Santosh Chavan recorded u/s 18 of MCOC Act. It is a weak piece of evidence and requires
corroboration. Considering the nature of evidence against applicants, embargo enunciated u/s 21(4)
of MCOC Act is not attracted against applicants.
4. Learned counsel for applicants in respective applications submitted that there is no cogent
evidence against applicants. The provisions of MCOC Act are not applicable against them. The coIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/168954367/

accused Laxman Chavan, Sanjaykumar @ Munna Babu Bula were granted bail in Bail Application
Nos.571 of 2018 and 945 of 2018.
5. Learned counsel for applicant in BA No.3352 of 2018 submitted that there is no evidence to
establish his link with the crime syndicate. There are no antecedents against him. The prosecution is
relying on the confession of the co-accused which is not corroborated by any evidence. It is further
submitted that there is no identification parade identifying the applicant as the person 4 of 6
904.BA.3352.2018.doc who is involved in the crime. Except recovery of three mobile phones at the
instance of applicant, there is no evidence to show his complicity in the crime. The advocate for
applicant in Bail Application No.1510 of 2018 submitted that there is no evidence of identification
parade against him and there is no recovery of any nature against him. Even there is no CDR record
to show his involvement in the crime. There is no evidence of his participation in the crime and the
prosecution is merely relying on the confessional statement of co-accused Santosh Chavan.
Whereas, advocate for applicant in Bail Application No.1924 of 2018 submitted that there is lack of
evidence to establish his connection with organized crime syndicate. It is submitted that at the most
the involvement of applicant can be attributed to the charge of receiver of stolen property. The
prosecution has not been able to show that the applicant is member of organized crime syndicate to
invoke the provisions of MCOC Act. It is submitted that the applicant is arrested on the basis of
statement of Kishor Budhwant. It is submitted that confessional statement of Santosh Chavan in
fact exonerates the applicant from being involved in the crime. The case of prosecution with
reference to exchange of cash amount towards sale of mobile phones cannot be accepted because the
alleged act had occurred during the period of demonetization and it would not have been possible to
arrange cash as indicated in the statement of witnesses. It is further submitted that the evidence of
witnesses relied upon by prosecution suffers from various infirmities in the nature of contradiction
and it is difficult to accept the said evidence. It is submitted that there is no parade to corroborate
the involvement of applicant in the crime. He is in custody from the date of arrest.
5 of 6 904.BA.3352.2018.doc
6. Learned APP on the contrary submitted that there is evidence to show involvement of applicants
in crime. It is submitted that the prosecution is relying on the confessional statement of co-accused
Santosh Chavan recorded u/s 18 of MCOC Act. It is submitted that the said accused has shown
involvement of accused in the crime. It is further submitted that applicant in Bail Application
No.3352 of 2018 was instrumental in bringing the tempo. It is submitted that in the confessional
statement of the co-accused it is indicated that the applicant in Bail Application No.3352 of 2018
had brought tempo which was used in commission of crime. It is further submitted that one another
case is registered against applicants in Bail Application No.1510 of 2018 and 1924 of 2018. However,
learned counsel representing applicants submitted that in the said case, the applicants were arrested
after the arrest was shown in present case. The said case was registered against unknown persons
and the applicants are released on bail. As observed hereinabove, as far as applicant in Bail
Application No.3352 of 2018 is concerned, there is no identification parade. Except recovery of three
mobile phones, there is no other evidence against him. Similarly as far as applicant in Bail
Application No.1510 of 2018 is concerned, except confessional statement recorded u/s 18 of MCOC
Act of co-accused, there is no evidence against the applicant. His role in the crime is not established.

As far as applicant in Bail Application No.1920 of 2018 is concerned, the prosecution has relied
upon recovery of 11 mobile phones. However, as stated above, there are discrepancies in the
evidence of witnesses relied upon by prosecution. There is nothing on record to link the applicant as
the person who is the member of organized crime syndicate. There are no other cases against him
except the case in which he was arrested after he is 6 of 6 904.BA.3352.2018.doc shown arrested in
the present case to show that he was involved in the activities of organized crime syndicate. The
confessional statement of the co-accused also does not show any corroborative circumstance against
the said applicant as person who is involved in any crime. The applicants are in custody from the
date of arrest. Investigation is completed and charge sheet is filed.
7. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case and nature of evidence against the applicants
in these applications, the rigors of Section 21(4) of MCOC Act would not be attracted in present
cases. Hence, case for grant of bail is made out. Hence, I pass following order :
ORDER
(i) Criminal Bail Application No.3352 of 2018, Criminal Bail Application No.1510 of 2018 and
Criminal Bail Application No.1924 of 2018 are allowed and disposed off;
(ii) The applicants in these Criminal Bail Applications be released on bail in connection with CR
No.I-07 of 2017 registered with Kongaon Police Station, on their furnishing PR bond in the sum of
Rs.25,000/- each with one or more sureties in the like amount;
(iii) The applicants in these Bail Applications are directed to report Kongaon Police Station once in a
month on every first Saturday between 10 am and 12 noon till conclusion of trial;
(iv) The applicants in these Bail Applications shall attend the Trial Court regularly on dates of
hearing of the case, unless exempted by the said Court for some reason.
