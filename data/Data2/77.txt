2.

Put in a nutshell, the relevant background aspects of this matter are as

follows: The appellant firm had taken the land in question on lease for a period
of 5 years (from 01.07.1972 to 30.06.1977) from its owner, Sri Nanamamalai
Jeer Mutt, Nanguneri, for plantation and co-related purposes. By the
notification dated 06.03.1976 issued under the Wild Life (Protection) Act,
1972, the land in question was proposed to be included in the wild life
sanctuary. However, a fresh long-term lease for a period of 25 years (from
01.07.1977 to 30.06.2002) was made in favour of the appellant. The appellant
and the Mutt attempted to get the land in question excluded from the

sanctuary but remained unsuccessful. On the other hand, proceedings for

award of compensation in relation to the land in question remained under
contemplation. However, instead of making any award, the collector issued
1

the order dated 19.11.1993, excluding the land in question from the limits of
wild life sanctuary. Being aggrieved by such exclusion, the Mutt and the
appellant filed a writ petition before the High Court, which was allowed by the
Single Judge but then, the Division Bench of High Court, in its judgment dated
18.09.1997, did not approve the order so passed by the Single Judge and,
while acknowledging the power of the Government to withdraw from the
notification, dismissed the writ petition but left it open for the appellant and the
Mutt to approach the appropriate forum in relation to their claim for damages.
Thereafter, on 08.06.1998, the appellant instituted the civil suit for damages
against the State while alleging that it had been prevented from using the land
in question from the year 1976 to the year 1993.
3.

The civil suit so filed by the appellant was decreed by the learned Single

Judge of the High Court but, the Division Bench reversed the decree and
dismissed the suit by way of its judgment and decree dated 26.02.2007 in
OSA Nos. 193 of 2002 and 178 of 2003.
4.

Having examined the matter in its totality, this Court found that after

issuance of the notification dated 06.03.1976 and inclusion of the subject land
therein, there was no occasion for the appellant acquiring any further right in
the land after expiry of the term of lease on 30.06.1977 and hence, the alleged
second lease for a period of 25 years was of no effect; and the appellant had
no right to claim damages from the State. It was also found that there was
nothing on record to suggest that appellant was prevented by the State from

2

going inside the forest and collecting usufructs and hence, there was no basis
for the appellant to maintain an action for damages.
5.

The question of limitation, though left unanswered by the Division

Bench of High Court, was also examined by this Court and it was found that in
the earlier proceeding, the appellant sought exclusion of the land from
sanctuary and asserted that State ought to take the land and pay
compensation whereas the claim in the present suit was founded on the
ground that the plaintiff had suffered loss due to the proceedings under Wild
Life (Protection) Act, 1972 and then, due to exclusion of the land in question
from acquisition. It was, therefore, found that the relief claimed in the present
suit was different and matter-in-issue was not the same as that of the earlier
proceeding and hence, the appellant was not entitled to the benefit of Section
14 of the Limitation Act.
6.

Having examined the record and the grounds stated, we are unable to

find any error apparent on the face of the record calling for review of the
judgment dated 20.08.2019.
7.

The review petition is, therefore, dismissed.
