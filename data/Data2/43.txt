DATED: MARCH 18, 2019 P.C.:
1. In this revision application, the applicant/accused is prosecuted under sections 302, 397 of the
Indian Penal Code r/w sections 37(1)(a) and 135 of the Mumbai Police Act in Sessions Case No.701
of 2011. It is the case of the prosecution that on 20 th May, 2011, the accused persons had entered
the shop of one Dharmaraj Jewellers at Chembur and they murdered the owner Shri Pankaj Vinod
Soni by cutting his throat. The accused persons murdered and thereafter robbed the said shop. They
sold the gold ornaments and obtained money. There are in all 5 accused who revn.634.2017_14.doc
are prosecuted before the Sessions Court for these offences. The present applicant/accused is
accused No.4. He had moved the application under section 227 of the Criminal Procedure Code
before the Sessions Court. However, the said application was rejected by order dated 27.9.2017.
Hence, this revision application.

applicant/accused and he has not committed any offence muchless the offence of robbery and
murder.
3. Per contra, learned Prosecutor has argued that this is a murder and robbery case and the

the co-accused Mangesh Sonar has given a statement before the police pursuant to which the gold
ornaments and the knife were recovered by the police under panchanama. He has taken the name of
this person as accused revn.634.2017_14.doc as the main person who helped him and other accused
to dispose of the ornaments.
4. At the outset, the portion and the statement relied on by the learned Prosecutor in the
memorandum recorded under section 27, is inadmissible. If at all, even if this person has played
some part in selling the gold ornaments which were robbed by the co- accused after murdering the
owner of the jewellery shop, the said act cannot constitute any offence of either under section 302 or
section 397. In the impugned order, the learned Sessions Judge has referred to and held that the
FIR, panchanama and the documents reveal that there is material against the applicant/accused.
However, the statements under the recovery panchanama are inadmissible and do not constitute
any offence. After query with the learned Prosecutor, nothing is shown and found in the FIR or any
document implicating the applicant / accused.
5. Thus, there is no material to frame charge under sections 397 or 302 r/w section 34 of the Indian
Penal Code. Hence, the order of the trial Court dated 27.9.2011 is hereby quashed and set aside.
