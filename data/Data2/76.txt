R. F. Nariman J.
This matter has a somewhat chequered history.
In 1943, Government of India requisitioned 4 acres and
34 gunthas of the land owned by one Rajabahadur Bhagwandas
Haridas, bearing Survey No. 120/2 (Part) of Village Malad,
Mumbai, in exercise of powers conferred under Rule 75A of
the

Defence

India

Rules,

1939.

On

27.07.1949,

the

Collector, Thane, de-requisitioned 2.68 acres in the Survey
No. 120 Part 2 out of the aforesaid 4 acres 34 gunthas.
Ultimately,

despite

requisitioned, a notification under Section 4(1) of the Land
Acquisition Act, 1894 (hereinafter referred to as ‘Act’),
was issued on 24.10.1975 acquiring the aforesaid extent of
8623 square meters.

The

on

the State till date.
In a proceeding that was filed, insofar as other lands
in Village Malad were concerned, covered by the same section
4 notification, this Court in Kulsum R. Nadiadwala v. State
of Maharashtra and Ors. (2012) 6 SCC 348, allowed an appeal
by the land owner.

After stating in paragraph 2 that the

very same section 4 notification was issued in order that a
Central Ordinance Depot for the Union of India be made for
defence purposes, the judgment records that the beneficiary
of these lands, being the Central Government, was served,
but did not appear at the time of hearing of the appeal.
The appellant in Kulsum R. Nadiadwala’s case (supra) argued
several points before this Court, which were resisted by the
learned

counsel

for

the

State

of

Maharashtra,

basically on the ground that the writ petition should have
been dismissed on the ground of delay and laches as was done
by the impugned High Court judgment.

2

CIVIL APPEAL NO. 3636 OF 2016

places in the locality in which the land proposed to be
acquired is situate, are cumulative conditions, both being
mandatory.

The Court then held: -

“13. In the instant case, the respondents before the
High Court had filed their reply affidavit. They did
not dispute the contentions of the appellants that
they had not issued any public notices as required
under Section 4 of the Act. They only reiterated that
such notification was published in the Official
Gazette. Since the mandatory requirement as required
under Section 4(1) of the Act is not complied with by
the
respondents,
while
acquiring
the
lands
in
question, in our opinion, the entire acquisition
proceedings requires to be declared as null and void.
14. This Court in J&K Housing Board v. Kunwar Sanjay
Krishan Kaul has observed that all the formalities of
serving notice to the interested person, stipulated
under Section 4 of the Act, has to be mandatorily
complied with in the manner provided therein, even
though the interested persons have knowledge of the
acquisition proceedings. This Court further observed
thus:
“32. It is settled law that when any statutory
provision provides a particular manner for doing
a particular act, the said thing or act must be
done in accordance with the manner prescribed
therefor in the Act. Merely because the parties
concerned
were
aware
of
the
acquisition
proceedings or served with individual notices
does not make the position alter when the
statute makes it very clear that all the
procedures/modes have to be strictly complied
with in the manner provided therein. Merely
because the landowners failed to submit their
objections within 15 days after the publication
of notification under Section 4(1) of the State
Act, the authorities cannot be permitted to
claim that it need not be strictly resorted to.”
15. In view of the conclusion that we have reached on
the first issue canvassed by the learned counsel for
the appellants, we do not think that other issues
that the learned counsel for the appellants has
raised and canvassed before us need to be answered.”

CIVIL APPEAL NO. 3636 OF 2016

It

may

only

be

mentioned

that

in

Kulsum

R.

Nadiadwala’s case (supra), the challenge was made by way of
a writ petition filed in 1987, as opposed to the present
challenge, which was made only in the year 2002.
Ms. Rekha Pandey, learned counsel appearing on behalf
of the appellant, has raised several points in support of
this appeal.

First and foremost, she adverted to an order

of this Court dated 27.03.2018 by which a Division Bench of
this Court has referred this matter to a larger Bench of
three Judges.

This order reads as follows:

“1. The land of the respondents was acquired vide
notification dated 24.10.1975 under Section 4 of the
Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (the Act). The said land
was earlier requisitioned in the years 1942 to 1945
for defence purpose. Award was made in the year 1986
and symbolic possession of the land was taken on
06.01.1987. Objections of the award were filed by the
respondents against the award. A reference under
Section 18 of the Act was made which was disposed of.
Thereafter, the writ petition was filed by the
respondents mainly on the ground that there was no
due publication of the notification under Section 4
of the Act which was a mandatory requirement.
2.The High Court upheld the plea of the respondents
relying upon judgment of this Court in “Kulsum R.
Nadiadwala Vs. State of Maharashtra” (2012) 6 SCC
348.
3.Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that
having regard to the fact that the land was already
being used for defence purpose since the year 1942 to
1945 and the notification under Section 4 issued on
24.10.1975 was challenged for the first time by the
writ petition filed on 24.06.2002, the High Court
should have dismissed the writ petition on the ground
of delay and laches as entertaining such petition
will seriously affect public interest. It was
submitted that view taken in the relied upon judgment
ignores the concept of laches.

4

CIVIL APPEAL NO. 3636 OF 2016

4.Learned counsel for the respondents submits that in
spite of delay and laches, this Court in the
aforesaid judgment quashed the acquisition.
5.We are of the view that delay and laches may be a
bar to challenge to the acquisition after 27 years.
In Tamil Nadu Housing Board, Chennaiversus M.
Meiyappan and ors (2010) 14 SCC 309 this Court held
that inland acquisition proceedings the Court should
not encourage stale litigation as it may hinder
projects of public importance. The contra view in
threeJudge Bench decision in Dayal Singh versus Union
of India (2003) 2SCC 593 was held to be in conflict
with the Constitution Bench judgment in Rabindranath
Bose versus Union of India (1970) 1 SCC 84 and threeJudge Bench judgment in Printers (Mysore) Ltd. versus
M.A. Rasheed(2004) 4 SCC 460. The said judgment was
cited with approval in recent judgment of threeJudge
Bench
in
Indore
Development
authority
versus
Shailendra (Dead) through Lrs. & Ors. (Civil Appeal
No.20982 of 2017 –pronounced on 8th February, 2018).
6.In view of above, the view taken by twoJudge Bench
in
Kulsum
R.Nadiadwala
versus
State
of
Maharashtra(2012) 6 SCC 348 to the effect that delay
and laches have to be ignored is not free from doubt.
7.Thus, we are of the view that the matter needs to
be placed before a Bench of three Judges.
8.Accordingly, let the papers be placed before
Hon’ble the Chief Justice of India for appropriate
directions.”
Ms. Pandey, learned counsel, has argued before us that
as a matter of law, such a huge delay in filing a writ
petition against Section 4 notification cannot possibly be
countenanced.
Nadiadwala’s

the

Nadiadwala’s case (supra).

She also raised the point that

was raised in the special leave petition filed by the Union
of India which is that Kulsum R. Nadiadwala’s case (supra)
is “per incuriam” inasmuch as it decided a point which arose
out

of

the

Amendment

Act

of

1984,

when

the

Section

4

notification was only of 1975, the 1984 Amendment Act not
being retrospective.

She further went on to state that, in

any case, the Constitution Bench is taking up, as one of the
pleas before it in Indore Development Authority v. Manohar
Lal and Others Etc. (SLP (C)Nos. 9036-9038 of 2016) whether
delay would apply as a good ground for dismissing a writ
petition on the ground of laches insofar as challenges to
land

proceedings

are

concerned,

and

that

we

should await the judgment of the Constitution Bench before
proceeding with the judgment in this case.

the

fact

that

the

this

case

is

for

important defence purposes and possession of this land has
been with the Union Government since 1942.

She also stated

that Kulsum R. Nadiadwala’s judgment, if properly read, did
not amount to quashing of the entire section 4 notification,
particularly in view of the last paragraph of the judgment,
where the claim of the appellant was restricted only to 50
6

CIVIL APPEAL NO. 3636 OF 2016

per cent of the land in question, the direction being that
the respondents shall hand over 50 per cent of the vacant
possession of the said land to the appellant forthwith.
As
learned

against
senior

these

submissions,

counsel

appearing

Shri
on

Shyam

behalf

Divan,
of

the

respondents, argued that that the section 4 notification in
both these cases being the same, and Kulsum R. Nadiadwala’s
case

being a final judgment of this Court in which a review

petition and a curative petition have been dismissed, the
said judgment would apply on all fours to the facts of this
case.

He pointed out that the question of delay, though

raised by the learned counsel who appeared on behalf of the
State, was not directly answered in Kulsum R. Nadiadwala’s
case inasmuch as, according to the Division Bench of this
Court in Kulsum R. Nadiadwala’s case, a mandatory condition
of a section 4 notification not being adhered to, would
amount to there being no acquisition at all in the eye of
law.

On this ground, he defended the impugned judgment

passed by the Bombay High Court.
Though this Court has, by its order dated 27.03.2018,
referred this case to a larger Bench in view of the decision
in Kulsum R. Nadiadwala’s case that delay and laches have to
be ignored, we are of the view that on the facts of this
case, we need not answer this question.

This is for the

reason that the section 4 notification that was struck down
in Kulsum R. Nadiadwala’s case is the very notification in
7

CIVIL APPEAL NO. 3636 OF 2016

the facts of this case.

We may also note that in paragraph

13 of the Kulsum R. Nadiadwala’s case set out hereinabove,
this

Court

quashed

the

entire

acquisition

proceedings

stating that they be declared as null and void.

We are

unable to agree with Ms.Pandey’s contention that the Section
4 notification not only deals with various other lands in
Village Malad but also deals with a land in a different
village

altogether

viz.,

Village

Wadhawan,

and

that

this

Court’s judgment did not go to the extent of declaring the
acquisition bad so far as village Wadhawan is concerned. So
far as village Malad is concerned, where the land in Kulsum
R. Nadiadwala’s
present

land,

case was land that was adjacent to the
the

very

section

4

notification

has

been

struck down and declared null and void, and this being the
case, it would not be in the interest of justice to allow
the present appeal in favour of the Union of India, as this
would amount to a discrimination between two persons who are
otherwise similarly placed.
Adverting to some of the other submissions made by
Ms.Pandey,

first

and

case,

High

Court

the

foremost,
dismissed

in

Kulsum

the

writ

R.

Nadiadwala’s

petition

filed

therein on the ground of there being a 12 years delay in
filing the writ petition, and not on the ground that there
was a one year delay as the Award in this case was passed
only in 1986.

Secondly, the factum of notices actually

being served in this case, as opposed to notices not being
8

CIVIL APPEAL NO. 3636 OF 2016

individually served in Kulsum R. Nadiadwala’s case, apart
from making no difference to mandatory conditions that have
to be followed, as held in Kulsum R. Nadiadwala, has been
repelled by the judgment under appeal as follows:
“11.
Nevertheless,
we
are
dealing
with
the
contentions raised by the First Respondent. Perusal
of the Writ Petition and in particular Clause (h) of
Paragraph 4 thereof shows that a specific contention
has been raised by the Petitioners that neither the
Petitioners nor their predecessors were served with
any notice and were not offered any opportunity of
raising objections to the Notification under Subsection (1) of Section 4 of the said Act.
……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..
……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………….
Affidavit of Shri Manoj Shankarrao Gohad, the
Special Land Acquisition Officer (4) is completely
silent as far as this factual and legal challenge in
this Petition is concerned.
………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………….
………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………….”

Insofar as the “per incuriam” point is concerned, this
can be disposed of by stating that even though newspaper
publication

of

the

section

4

notification

came

in

by

amendment for the first time in 1984, the requirement of
public

notice

where

the

land

is

situate

in

addition

to

publication in the Official Gazette, was always there from
the inception.

Kulsum R. Nadiadwala’s case did not deal

with newspaper publication at all. It only dealt with the
requirement

of

publication

in

the

Official

Gazette

and

public notices of the substance of the notification being

9

CIVIL APPEAL NO. 3636 OF 2016

given in the locality in which the lands are acquired, both
of

which

were

held

to

be

cumulative

and

mandatory

requirements of section 4.
So

far

as

the

Indore

Development

Authority’s

case

(supra) is concerned, the Constitution Bench is seized of
several questions, all of which pertain to the construction
of

section

24

Transparency

in

of

the
Land

Right

to

Fair

Acquisition,

Compensation

and

Rehabilitation

and

Resettlement Act, 2013.
This being the case, and regard being had to what we
have stated hereinabove, it is wholly unnecessary for us to
adjourn this case in order to await the judgment of the
Constitution Bench in this case.
Given the fact that this is a Defence project in which
possession has been with the Union since 1942, the same
facts would obtain as in Kulsum R. Nadiadwala’s case in
which relief has been granted to Kulsum R. Nadiadwala.

This

case, therefore, cannot lead to a different conclusion on
similar facts.
As to the argument that no declaration that the entire
section 4 notification is quashed inasmuch as the claim of
the appellants in Kulsum R. Nadiadwala’s case was restricted
only

to

50

per

cent

of

the

lands

in

question,

it

is

important to make a distinction between a declaration of law
which would bind other future cases under Article 141 of the
Constitution of India and an order made in the facts of the
10

CIVIL APPEAL NO. 3636 OF 2016

case which may equally be made to do substantial justice on
the facts of a given case, sometimes under Article 142.
On a reading of paragraph 16 of Kulsum R. Nadiadwala’s
judgment,

it

is

important

to

note

that

though

the

appellant’s claim was restricted to only 50 per cent of the
land

in

question,

so

far

as

the

other

50

per

cent

is

concerned, the judgment itself makes a reference to the fact
that the appellants are legal heirs of one deceased Ismail
Nadiadwala and that there was another claimant whose name
was Ibrahim Nadiadwala to whom, presumably, 50 per cent of
the property went.

Since only Ismail Nadiadwala’s heirs

were prosecuting the appeal, this direction appears to have
been made.
This being the case, we dismiss the appeal of the
Union.
