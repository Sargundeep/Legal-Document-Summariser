DATED: JANUARY 10, 2019 P.C.:
1. These two Criminal Revision Applications are moved against the order dated 20.10.2018 passed
by the learned Special Judge, CBI ACB, Pune. Both the matters are taken up together as the issue
involved is the same and the accused is one and the same in both the cases i.e., Special Case Nos.82
of 2016 and 83 of 2016, whereby the accused had sought discharge under section 227 of the
Criminal Procedure Code.

420, 468, 471 and 120B of the Indian Penal Code and also under sections 13(2) r/w section 13(1)(d)
of the Prevention of Corruption Act. The applicant/accused is not a public servant. He had
approached the Bank of Maharashtra for credit facility and loan in the year 2012 by producing

Limited were granted by the bank. The said credit facility and loans were advanced in favour of
these two companies which are run by the present applicant/accused. The applicant/accused repaid
an amount of Rs.2.5 crores against each loan till March, 2015. However, as the remaining loan
amount was not repaid and the account of the company has become an NPA, the prosecution was
initiated by the Bank of Maharashtra and the complaint was registered with the CBI and thereafter,
the CBI investigated the matter and filed chargesheet in both the cases. Hence, the
applicant/accused moved applications for discharge under section 227 of the Criminal Procedure
Code. However, the revn.660.2018+_906n907.doc applications were rejected and hence, he filed
these revision applications.
3. The learned Counsel for the applicant/accused has submitted that the applicant/accused has not
committed any offence of cheating or forgery. He being a layman, cannot be prosecuted under the
Prevention of Corruption Act for the offences under the said Act. He argued that the loan was
obtained in the year 2012 and repayment of total Rs.5 crores was made till March 2015. During the
pendency of these revisions, a proposal was also given by way of one time settlement to the Bank by
letter dated 27.12.2018 and the applicant/accused is ready to pay Rs.7.45 crores against the dues of
Rs.9.45 crores. He submitted that no forgery is committed by the applicant/accused and on the
point of NA, reports submitted by the concerned officers of the CBI are defective and they are
pertaining to some other land in some other village and therefore, the orders of refusal of discharge
passed by the learned Special Judge in both the cases are to be set aside and the applicant be
discharged.
4. The learned Counsel appearing for the CBI while opposing these applications has submitted that
there is sufficient evidence revn.660.2018+_906n907.doc available before the Court in the
chargesheet to frame charge of cheating and forgery against the applicant/accused. The learned
Counsel has relied on the statement of one E.H. Zore on the point of production of false reports
showing a highly exorbitant valuation of two lands situate at village Jalochi, Taluka Baramati i.e., at
Rs.8,45,65,500/- in respect of one land and Rs.9,07,55,200/- in respect of another land, whereas
the actual market value was Rs.33 lakhs for one land and Rs.63 lakhs for the other land. He has
further relied on the statement of one Hemant Vitthalrao Nikam, who has stated about the forgery
of N.A. order No.NA/SR/56/2013. He submitted that on the said number, the NA was issued in
favour of one Dilip Vitthal Divekar in respect of the land at Khadki, Daund and on the basis of the
said NA order, this fake order dated 4.3.2013 was prepared. These NA orders were used with
knowledge by the applicant/accused to obtain bigger loan amounts.
5. Heard submissions. Considering the documents and statements placed before the Court. In view
of the submissions made by the learned Counsel for the CBI, I am of the view that there is prima
facie evidence against the applicant/accused to revn.660.2018+_906n907.doc frame charges of
cheating and forgery, as rightly held by the learned Special Judge that charges under Prevention of
Corruption Act against this accused cannot be framed, as he is not a public servant. No illegality is
found in the order of the learned Special Judge.
6. Hence, the Revision Applications are dismissed.
