CORAM : R.K. DESHPANDE &
VINAY JOSHI, JJ.

DATE : FEBRUARY 14, 2019.
ORAL JUDGMENT (PER R.K. Deshpande, J.) :
In exercise of powers conferred by Section 48[7] read with Section 24 of the Maharashtra Land
Revenue Code , 1966 the Tahsildar, Hingna has passed an order holding that the appellants are
found guilty of the theft of Minor Minerals/soil, excavated from Survey Nos. 3/1, 2, 3 and 4 of
Mouza Wagdhara and Survey No.1, which is a Government land, ad-measuring 126.14 Hectors,
without permission of the Competent Authority, and the same was utilized for leveling and
preparing layout road.
2. This order dated 22.10.2003, was the subject matter of challenge in Appeal before the Additional
Collector, who dismissed the same on 30.06.2004. A revision carried further to the Additional
Commissioner, Nagpur Division, Nagpur also came to be dismissed on 18.01.2005. The learned
Single Judge of this Court has dismissed Writ Petition No.1138/2005, by his judgment and order
dated 27.01.2006. Misc. Civil Application seeking Review of Judgment lpa110.07 the said order, was
also dismissed by the learned Single Judge on 06.04.2007. Hence, all these orders are subject
matter of challenge in this Letters Patent Appeal.
3. The undisputed factual position is that appellants are owners of Survey Nos. 3/1, 3/2, 3/3 and
3/4, which is adjoining to Government land bearing Survey No.1, on its Eastern side, ad- measuring
126.14 H.R. The findings recorded by the Authorities below, as well as by the learned Single Judge,
indicate excavation of 19374.5 cubic meters of minor minerals, which is equivalent to 6847 brass of
minor minerals from Survey Nos. 3/1, 2, 3 and 4, so also Survey No.1, adjacent to Eastern side of the
land owned by the appellants. During visit of Tahsildar, Hingna on 09.10.2003, between 4 - 5 p.m.,
it was found that a JCB machine and Tipper were in operation, excavating the minor minerals/soil
from the area, hence, both the machines were seized and subsequently released on supratnama. On
the basis of the two reports - i.e. one dated 21.10.2003, conducted by the Survey and another dated
28.10.2003 by the Director of Geology and Mining, it was held that appellants have committed theft
of 19374.5 cubic meters of minor minerals, which is equivalent to 6847 brass, and hence, a royalty of
Rs.61,62,300/- was sought to be recovered from appellants, along Judgment lpa110.07 with penalty
of Rs. 3,42,350/-.
4. After going through the entire records with the assistance of the learned counsel for the respective
parties, we find that the orders passed by the Authorities below are deficient to connect the charge of
unauthorized excavation of quantified minor minerals. There is no definite finding as to the quantity

of the minor minerals excavated from the land owned by the appellants and the land owned by the
Government. Though appellants have admitted, and which is also the finding accepted by the
learned Single Judge about unauthorized or illegal extraction, it was the case of appellants that for
the purpose of leveling the layout and preparing roads, one Shri Vijay Oberoi, was engaged with the
equipments and vehicles during the period from 25.10.2002 to 17.03.2003, and he has transported
the minerals after paying the royalty to the contractor one Shri Sudhakar Madhukar Wankhede for
93 trucks of murum. We find that this aspect is also not been considered by the Authorities below,
which has impact on the controversy involved in this appeal.
5. There is nothing on record to show that the two reports i.e. 21.10.2003 and 28.10.2003, by the
Director of Geology and Mining and the Surveyor, were supplied to appellants. The extent Judgment
lpa110.07 of theft of minor minerals from the government land is required to be ascertained. This
can be done by remanding the matter back to the Commissioner/Additional Commissioner, Nagpur
Division, Nagpur to decide the same afresh.
6. In view of above, we partly allow the Writ Petition No.1138/2005, filed by the
appellants/petitioners, by setting aside the order dated 18.01.2005, passed by the Additional
Commissioner, Nagpur Division, Nagpur and remand the matter back to him to consider and decide
the same in the light of the observations made by us above, after hearing the parties concern.
7. It is informed to us that appellants have deposited an amount of Rs. 6,50,476/- with the
respondent Authorities on 04.11.2003. On 29.02.2008, this Court passed an order, restraining
appellants not to encumber 18 plots in any way as per orders passed by the learned Single Judge on
30.01.2006 on Civil Application No. 460/2006, filed in Writ Petition No.1138/2005. It was also
made clear that the appellant shall not be entitled to dispose of the land, except 18 plots, the
possession of which is already given to the government.
