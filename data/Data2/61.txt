further Rigorous Imprisonment for 6 months.

2.

Learned

counsel

for

the

applicant

specifcally

submitted that there is no convincing evidence establishing
applicant's involvement in the present crime muchcless,
that applicant at any point of time demanded bribe. It is
contended that even case of prosecution on this point of
demand as well as alleged conversation between the
applicant and complainant is not at all convincing to be
acted upon and has thus contended that application be
allowed.

3.

Learned APP submitted that from the evidence of

complainant it is established that applicant had demanded
bribe for releasing one of the accused involved in theft
case, which ofence was investigated by the applicant,
while he was working as Assistant Police Inspector and
therefore, prayed that application be rejected.

4.

It appears, that on 15th July, 2015, applicant was

posted as Assistant Police Inspector at Mankhurd Police
Station and was investigating Crime No. 62/2015 registered

for the ofence of theft against one Amit Jaiswal, friend of
the complainant and for that purpose, complainant visited
police station on 15th July, 2015. At that time, one P.S.I. Javir
extended threats to complainant to arrest in the same
crime and alleged to have demanded bribe of Rs.5,000/c.

It is further case of prosecution that on the same day,
applicant on beating complainant in the police station
demanded and attempted to obtain said amount of
Rs.5,000/c and again on 16 th July, 2015 on complainant's
meeting applicant in the police station in noon hours
demanded Rs.15,000/c. As complainant was not interested
to pay the bribe, he contacted Anti Corruption Bureau
Office and lodged report.

5.

In the background of above case of prosecution,

evidence of complainant would reveal that on his arriving in
the police station to meet his friend Amit Jaiswal, P.S.I. Javir
extended threats to him to involve in the same crime in
which

Amit

Jaiswal

was

arrested

and

demanded

Rs.10,000/c. However, since he was not having all that
amount, he requested for grant of one day time. It has

further come in the evidence that at that time applicant
extended threats to complainant to falsely implicate him in
the crime and demanded Rs.50,000/c to protect him, that
amount was negotiated to Rs.20,000/c. He further stated
that he therefore, visited office of A.C.B. and lodged his
report (Exhibitc9). Admittedly, there is no prosecution
initiated against any officer by name P.S.I. Javir, though
according to the case of complainant, initial demand of
Rs.10,000/c was by him. Though case of prosecution
appears to be of alleged demand by the applicant on 15 th
July, 2015 of Rs.5,000/c

which was on 16 th July, 2015

enhanced to Rs.15,000/c. Evidence of P.W. 1 complainant c
Shamshuddin Shaikh is that demand of Rs.10,000/c was
made by one officer by name P.S.I. Javir and thereafter on
the following day, demand was made by applicant of
Rs.50,000/c, which was negotiated to Rs.20,000/c. Having
considered evidence as aforesaid, case of prosecution is
not found unfolded as to what was the amount alleged to
be demanded by the applicant.

On the point of incident, evidence of complainant

would further reveal that on his attending Mankhurd Police

Station alongwith independent witness and members of
raiding team, he met applicant. However, at that time he
scolded complainant and directed him to go away from the
police station and therefore, he came back and met the
raiding team officers. In that view of the matter, there is no
evidence, establishing applicant's involvement.

Though learned APP contended that the conversation

whatsoever has taken place between complainant and
applicant

has

been

recorded. Evidence

Complainant on this aspect would reveal that he visited
Mankhurd Police Station with Digital Voice Recorder. One
female employee from the office of A.C.B. accompanied
him. He was scolded by the applicant and was directed to
leave the police station. Except this, there is nothing on
record. In fact, in his earlier version also apart from
doubtful case of prosecution on the point of demand, there
is no case of demand established by the prosecution after
complainant arrived in the police station for lodging of
report. Complainant's evidence on the point of recording of
verifcation panchnama is by way of omission as has
admitted that no such fact is mentioned in his report
