Crl.A.@S.L.P.(Crl.)No.3928 of 2020

herein was the accused.

After investigation of the crime,

chargesheet dated 11.01.2008 was filed against the second

On

4.

The complainant, who is the father of the deceased boy, has

filed appeal challenging the order of sentence dated 17 th August
2019 passed by ASJ/Special Judge (NDPS), North District,
Rohini Courts, Delhi in Sessions Case No.58259 of 2016 seeking
enhancement of sentence to death penalty. In the appeal filed
before the High Court under Section 372, Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973 (for short, ‘Cr.PC’), it was his case that the
sentence

of

life

imprisonment

imposed

on

the

second

respondent­convict is inadequate and needs to be enhanced to
death penalty.

Vide impugned judgment dated 27 th November

2019 the High Court of Delhi has dismissed the appeal as not
maintainable.
5.

We have heard Sri Ashwani Bhardwaj, learned advocate

appearing for the appellant and Sri Chirag M. Shroff, learned
counsel appearing for the State of NCT of Delhi.
6.

It is contended by learned counsel for the appellant, though

the respondent no.2 had committed murder of an innocent child,
the Sessions Court, instead to award punishment of death
penalty, has awarded only imprisonment for life. It is contended
that in view of proviso to Section 372, Cr.PC which gives right to
prefer appeal to the victim, when the accused is convicted for
3

Crl.A.@S.L.P.(Crl.)No.3928 of 2020

lesser offence, there is no reason to restrict the scope of appeal
only for a lesser offence but not for lesser sentence.

It is

submitted that on 15.10.2007 when the son of the appellant was
kidnapped and demand of ransom was made which was also paid
to the second respondent but after kidnap his son was brutally
murdered.

As such, it is submitted that it is a fit case for

enhancement of sentence from life imprisonment to death
penalty, for the second respondent.

The learned counsel has

submitted that the High Court has not considered the provision
under Section 372, Cr.PC properly vis­a­vis the judgments
referred to and dismissed the appeal, contrary to plain meaning
of Section 372, Cr.PC.
7.

On the other hand it is submitted by learned counsel for

the State of NCT of Delhi that a reading of provision under
Section 372 and Section 377 of Cr.PC makes it clear that the
appeal under Section 372 Cr.PC by the victim is a qualified one
which is maintainable in the event of acquittal of the accused or
convicting

for

lesser

offence

or

for

imposing

inadequate

compensation only, whereas under Section 377 Cr.PC State
Government is empowered to prefer appeal to the High Court in
the event of inadequate sentence by the Sessions Court.

It is

stated by learned counsel that for enhancement of sentence,
victim cannot maintain appeal under Section 372 of Cr.PC.

8.

Having heard learned counsel on both sides, we have

perused the material on record and the relevant provisions of the
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.
9.

Chapter XXIX of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973

deals with ‘Appeals’ and Section 372 makes it clear that no
appeal to lie unless otherwise provided by the Code or any other
law for the time being in force. It is not in dispute that in the
instant case appellant has preferred appeal only under Section
372, Cr.PC. The proviso is inserted to Section 372, Cr.PC by Act
5 of 2009. Section 372 and the proviso which is subsequently
inserted read as under:

“372. No appeal to lie unless otherwise provided.
– No appeal shall lie from any judgment or order of a
Criminal Court except as provided for by this Code or
by any other law for the time being in force:
Provided that the victim shall have a right to
prefer an appeal against any order passed by the
Court acquitting the accused or convicting for a
lesser offence or imposing inadequate compensation,
and such appeal shall lie to the Court to which an
appeal ordinarily lies against the order of conviction
of such Court.”
A reading of the proviso makes it clear that so far as victim’s
right of appeal is concerned, same is restricted to three
eventualities, namely, acquittal of the accused; conviction of the
accused

for

lesser

offence;

or
5

for

imposing

inadequate

Crl.A.@S.L.P.(Crl.)No.3928 of 2020

compensation.

While the victim is given opportunity to prefer

appeal in the event of imposing inadequate compensation, but at
the same time there is no provision for appeal by the victim for
questioning the order of sentence as inadequate, whereas Section
377, Cr.PC gives the power to the State Government to prefer
appeal for enhancement of sentence.

While it is open for the

State Government to prefer appeal for inadequate sentence under
Section 377, Cr.PC but similarly no appeal can be maintained by
victim under Section 372, Cr.PC on the ground of inadequate
sentence.

It is fairly well settled that the remedy of appeal is

creature of the Statute.

Unless same is provided either under

Code of Criminal Procedure or by any other law for the time being
in force no appeal, seeking enhancement of sentence at the
instance of the victim, is maintainable.

Further we are of the

view that the High Court while referring to the judgment of this
Court in the case of National Commission for Women v. State
of Delhi & Anr. (2010) 12 SCC 599 has rightly relied on the
same and dismissed the appeal, as not maintainable.

10.

For the aforesaid reasons, we do not find any merit in this

appeal, so as to interfere with the impugned order passed by the
High Court. The appeal is accordingly dismissed.
